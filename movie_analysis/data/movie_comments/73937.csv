This is such a good movie so underratedï»¿
"The actual movie is way more chill and ""wanderlust"" than this trailer is selling it to be.ï»¿"
Wowï»¿
seek peaceï»¿
Owen Wilson's character did nothing wrong. Change my mind.ï»¿
It feels like they did everything they could to avoid explaining that it's a movie about bird-watchers.ï»¿
2018 anyone?ï»¿
""" Which one is cheaper ?""  :D  :D :Dï»¿"
I love this film and the actors are so awesome thank you so much guy's..ï»¿
movie is better than the trailer!!ï»¿
the worst movie of Rosamund Pikeï»¿
the big year is so goodï»¿
nice trailer hahahaï»¿
great film..I really appreciate movies all throughout my life even the classics like lured by Lucille ball...but this to me is another one.ï»¿
Not a single mention that this is about them looking at birds lolï»¿
"amazing movie , Jack Black so funny ^_^ï»¿"
Underrated feel good movie.ï»¿
Steve martin Is not my cup of teaï»¿
Then try a cup of coffee.ï»¿
Man I remember seeing this on tv what seems like a long time ago and it randomly popped in my head so I had to look it up and it was such a great movie and is really underrated. I gotta watch again soonï»¿
Love this beautiful film soo much  what a joy!!ï»¿
The trailer sucks but the movie is awesomeï»¿
nice movie...kinda relaxing and beautiful landscapesï»¿
One of my most favorite movies.ï»¿
Just watched the movie. It was awesome. Loved it. Pretty good movie for such a shitty trailer.ï»¿
"Love the actors, hated the trailer, so I was on the fence. But I think I'll probably end up watching it now.ï»¿"
Shit trailer for a really funny and relaxing filmï»¿
I'm not even going to watch this for free ...ï»¿

+Jiminy JibJab AdBlock is the gayest thing ever.ï»¿
@The DuppeÂ It's 2016. Gay isn't an insult anymore.ï»¿
@Jiminy JibJabÂ Well sorry. AdBlock is for low life thieves. Better?Â ï»¿
"@The DuppeÂ I don't 'pay' by watching ads. I 'pay' with money. I'm not some indentured servant. I don't 'pay' for things by subjecting myself to forced behaviors. My time is worth more than the paltry fraction of a cent that gets paid by an advertising firm. I wasn't involved in that negotiation, and since it isn't at all enforceable, all parties involved in that decision can get fucked.If your content is worth actual money, put it behind a paywall and charge for it. If you have a good for sale that can be infinitely replicated, it's value is zero dollars. Time to evolve your model to capitalize in a more sensible way. It's called 'progress'.ï»¿"
"@Jiminy JibJab A website gets their income from ads, you use the website without watching the ads, I assume you always donate to those websites then?ï»¿"
"@The DuppeÂ Correction: Some websites get some income from ads. Some websites also get some income from harvesting my personal data without my permission, selling it without my permission, and implanting malware onto my system.Â Well, they used to, before I started using Ublock Origin, Ghostery, Spyhunter, etc. Unfortunately, there are millions of unsuspecting rubes that have no clue, leading to a goldmine for unscrupulous website owners at the expense of the personal info, cpu memory and computing power of the unsuspecting visitor.Â The ads are not the only way that websites capitalize on people. They're just part of the gouging.Â Of course, it doesn't take someone with a masters in economics to understand that you can always capitalize on many other ways other than taking advantage of your audience.Â There are also the millions of indefensible or difficult to defend devices out there such as video game consoles, phones, and other smart devices that most people simply just deal with your ads and malware on, so don't act like any of your precious bottom feeding data thieves are starving in the streets. If anything, they're multiplying like the parasitic bacteria that they are.ï»¿"
+Jiminy JibJab AdBlock doesn't do anything to people harvesting your data. Using AdBlock just shows that you can't watch couple pictures laying on the sides of websites to support them. Basically just shows that you are a self centered douchebag.ï»¿
"@The DuppeÂ I don't use 'adblock'. I do use some extensions that happen to block ads also. Ads are no longer limited to just pictures.Â Your ad-hominem attacks show the weakness in your failed arguments. I don't give a shit what you call me. If you want to try to do something about it, let's meet up and settle it in person.ï»¿"
"@The DuppeÂ Oh. I've been to Helsinki. Your country sucks and is laden with heroin addicts. The food is god awful. Go practice in your amateur black metal band, pale little fella. You probably listen to Children of Bodom and have a vitamin D deficiency.Â By the way, you don't like adblock, but scandinavia is largely the epicenter of actual piracy. Hello pot, kindly meet the kettle. You likely have multiple pirated programs on your computer living in that region. Your neighbors from the pirate bay have done a lot of people a lot of good.ï»¿"
"+Jiminy JibJab LMAO, is that coming from an American? Our country sucks, because we have free schools and free health care? And what comes to food, atleast we have something natural. Also if you want to talk about drugs... Well firstly they are MUCH less common in here than in USA and the most popular one is probably weed. I also don't listen to any kind of metal, probably over 90% of people here don't. It's funny how you try to diss me for my country when you don't know jack shit about it :D Have fun with Trump.ï»¿"
"That escalated quickly guys.Â ï»¿"
"+Jiminy JibJab LMAO, your insults are getting weaker. Calling me pale and a liar, wow gotta watch out. You have just proved here that you don't know shit about anything and fall in the stereotype of a dumb, fat, narcistic Americunt. It's not a suprise that you vote for Trump.ï»¿"
@The DuppeÂ Why are you still talking when you have ads to watch? Get to work! Trump wins New York in a landslide! Boo-yah!ï»¿
+Jiminy JibJab LMAO Trump is probably gonna drive USA to bankruptcy.ï»¿
@The DuppeÂ Because Obama hasn't already?ï»¿
@Jiminy JibJabÂ Only to the edgeï»¿
"@The DuppeÂ Noted. Thanks, I'll refer to that thought as I vote Trump June 7.ï»¿"
.this trailer literally never mentions its all about birding...ï»¿
"+Leviathan 77 I know, rightï»¿"
yap..ï»¿
"Easily the worst film that any of them have ever done, which says a lot when you include Jack Black's resume.ï»¿"
@Jiminy JibJab Everybody has their opinion i supposeï»¿
I guess Father of the Bride II was a pretty low point as well. Still though..ï»¿
Like true bird photographers use a dirty nikon with such a tiny lens ;) ï»¿
Did Jack Black get fatter?ï»¿
The Big RaveÂ ï»¿
"It's sad that critics hated this film. For some reason, I really enjoyed it.ï»¿"
How?ï»¿
"@Jiminy JibJab Why don't you like it? I love it for the characters with decent acting for some(For me this is one of Jack Black's best performance), It wasn't completely obvious on what was gonna happen, and it just had a feel good vibe to it(well for me anyways). Though I would agree that calling this movie a comedy is not the best as there were so few laughs and this feels more like a coming of age or drama story.ï»¿"
@MrsTwinLoverÂ It's great if you're into mundane films about mundane people doing mundane things.ï»¿
"@Jiminy JibJab so pretty much you dislike this because it's not exciting or out-worldly? Understandable but being a calm film doesn't make it a bad film. Then again it is not good when a comedy makes you more subdued then laughing but as a film by itself, it wasn't that bad.ï»¿"
"I think critics don't adjust their reviews to the genre of the movie. This movie should be reviewed on the basis of a feel good comedy, and by that standard it was exceptionalï»¿"
"same here, man. Plus, narration by John Cleeseï»¿"
as someone calls the ringtone blackjack in the movie The big year?ï»¿
ok :3ï»¿
Great movie!!!ï»¿
any movies like this ? pls tell meÂ ï»¿
"It's refreshing to see a comedy without fart jokes and vulgarities, it's rare nowadays.ï»¿"
I watched this it is kinda funny in some partsï»¿
I watched this... and i thought this was suppose to be a comedy?ï»¿
"+Adam D.Gouveia Yeah, it really wasn'tï»¿"
"I watch any movie of Jack Black, that guy shines.ï»¿"
"HEY BABES... is not SHELDON COOPER, he is Dr. SHELDON COOPER, ""BS, MS, MA, PhD and SCD...O-M-G, right?""ï»¿"

there is jim parsons!! he is the best!ï»¿
"""Sheldon Copper"" 1:50ï»¿"
"'Hi, Im Steve Martin....I used to be funny!'ï»¿"
Steve Martin never agesï»¿
This movies was incredible and life-changing. I don't know why critics bashed it.ï»¿
"Not like our bird competition but I actually watched the whole thing and enjoyed it.ï»¿"
Randomly looking at trailers.. Anyone else? :)ï»¿
It's a great movie.ï»¿
The REAL birdman...the bird's the word!ï»¿
"this move is  and old Guy , and fat guy and a suicidal guy with a crooked nose, birdwatching . ï»¿"
i watched this in economics class and i have to write an essay about the economic opportunities they missed by participating. glad my teacher chose such a good movie xDï»¿
"Like Owen Wilson's character said in the movie, when the girl got attacked by hungry birds, whilst saving her very expensive scarf: ""Very Hitchcockian"". It was a nice little tribute to ""The Master of Suspense"", who undoubtedly would have been sardonically smiling from above and saying approvingly: ""Delighted"". So on the whole, another excellent job from David Frankel who, in my eyes anyway, definitely got what it takes, since he made that rather brilliant ""The Devil wears Prada"". ""That's all...""ï»¿"
"Yes, It's 100% Sheldon Cooper.ï»¿"
"This is the funniest movie ever. I don't care what anyone says. Yes, I've seen Wayne's World.ï»¿"
1:50 Jim Parsons...I'm seriously gonna watch this movie to see Sheldon:))ï»¿
There's nothing better than Creedence for mid-life crisis movies.ï»¿
hahaha same problem here mateï»¿
well they did take pictures.... on their Bird Targets...... =)ï»¿
"they take a picture on most bird but some not. when jack and steve ride helicopter to see a bird the pilot ask them if they want to take a picture of it, they said no.ï»¿"
"they did,ï»¿"
I just finished watching this at Fox.... WOW Great Movie........  Boschtick is the winner but to be the greatest......Major Things are sacrificed.... what a sad LIFE.ï»¿
how do they score? they didn't take photograph of the bird. i mean what if someone lied and say he saw 760 birds?ï»¿
EXACTLYï»¿
Great little film about passions and where they can lead you.ï»¿
"Diane Wiest, who played Jack Black's mother in this movie, is only 3 years younger than Steve Martin. This is also the second movie to feature Diane and Steve, the first was Ron Howard's Parenthood.ï»¿"
He has like 0.5 seconds in this trailer and everyone's like OMG SHELDONï»¿
1:49 Wtf sheldon?!?!ï»¿
I rented this movie from my local library. I enjoyed this movie. I have to give it a 7 out of 10.ï»¿
I spend more time watching trailers than i do watching the movies i eventually end up picking.ï»¿

Jack black is really funnyï»¿
vÃ_x upp fÃ¶r helvete!ï»¿
You wanna have sexual intercourse with Owen Wilson!ï»¿
i hope steve martin loses his fucknig voice. i would've watched this movie if he wasn't in it...FUCK YOU STEVE MARTIN ï»¿
ok with a cast like this i wanted a real comedy...sure it was a good ending..ill even say awesome..but just the ending..i was laughing sometimes through the movie thinkin to my self ''im actually seeing a movie about bird watching.great!''ï»¿
"there are so many people obsessed with their hobbies that they are losing the most important things in their life.that is too bad,because the price is really bigï»¿"
"Brilliant inspirational movie, My all time favourite.ï»¿"
"""Luke Owen""ï»¿"
"It's interesting how they totally downplayed the bird watching in the trailer.   It sounds like they're just taking a ""big year"" off from their lives to have general adventure.  I guess they thought the bird watching angle would be box office poison.  As it turns out, it was. ï»¿"
1:50 was that SHELDON COOPER!?! fuck it i'm watching thisï»¿
"Personally this is my favorite all time movie. Its inspirational, cute, funny. Its got everything.ï»¿"
The big year was by far one of the best movies I've seen. Highly recommended if you've seen those Planet Earth and Blue Planet documentaries by David Attenborough.ï»¿
Awesome! Steve Martin hasn't been in a film for ages ! Focusing in his music which is good glad he's back in the screen :)ï»¿
"Wish I had known about this when it was in theaters. Kind of inspiring, though!ï»¿"
This movie is awesome. I love it. Its not a comedy movie- its not an action movie- its a movie that look into the obsession of aviary world. (Bird) i'm not a bird fan but this movie is entertaining.ï»¿
I can't agree more! I wasted 2h of my life!ï»¿
"the worst movie EVERï»¿"
Cool story broï»¿
Are you kidding me? This movie was awesome! :D One of my favesï»¿
I have been a birder for 40 years. I was amazed at how much research was done for this film to make it authentic. Many scenes used CGI to exagerate the effects. Real fallouts aren't nearly that visible in the sky. Most birds are really small. But this movie was well done and it is now one of my very favorites. I am sorry it took me so long before I finally saw it. ï»¿
my favorite movie 2011-12 great sound track beautiful picture amazing work at the ending credits as well when they show all species of birdsï»¿
"Should have more beautiful scenes of birds in this movie!!it could be a nice movie if they really emphasize on some points.I would love more beautiful sceneries or wildlife...but they weren't emphasize on anything. that's why the movie gets plain. ï»¿"
Worst movie ever.ï»¿
The should be about Jack Black.ï»¿
"It was a very good movie, much better than I expected. Great characters!ï»¿"
Great film. Not gonna give you a cheap laugh per minute but a great story with great characters. Bostick!ï»¿
@HELLHamster16 super gay!!!ï»¿

This was definitely not their year.ï»¿
"People need to stop obsessing over Jim Parsons. Yes, Big Bang Theory is funny, but that doesn't mean that he makes a film. Steve Martin, although past his time, has been in some films that will be seen as a movie everyone will remember. Jim Parsons has nothing on his career. Jack Black is a naturally hilarious person and obviously has done something right, because he's incredibly famous. Owen Wilson has also made more for himself than Jim by far. Big Bang Theory isn't everything YouTube.ï»¿"

Watchable movie..i kinda enjoyed it 2 nights ago..dnt read the negative comments ;)ï»¿
"watched the movie, i didn't hate it but i was expecting more to be honest. If you expect a really funny movie then  I recommend you to pick another movie. All of the jokes are in the trailer, seriously.ï»¿"
"Steve Martin is almost certainly has the longest career in comedy then anyone else in film today, but he stopped being funny and has become a shadow of his former self (as have his films), the leads appear to be enthusiatic, but in truth more than a little desperate, 3 comic actors who's careers are not exactly going great guns. $41 million budget, $7.4 million at the box office, that just about says it all for me. It was not afterall a big year, but a big flop.ï»¿"
"well..1. thats not ""Sheldon"" :D    2. you see about 10 birds in the  movie 3 there is about 3-4 jokes only and nothing more.. i was bored for 1h43m  :(ï»¿"

"you know what, this film is actually quite funny, just because it's about bird watching doesn't mean that's all it's about, it's barely even about the birds, it's about the 3 mens lives, jack black is bloody hilarious in this, steve martin and owen wilson are also on top form, this isn't the worlds best comedy, but it's also no where near as bad as people below are saying.

"Not a bad movie, too bad the trailer doesn't accurately depict the movie, AT ALL!  I thought this was supposed to be a comedy; the trailer doesn't mention any reference to 'birding'.  But seriously, how else are they going to get people to come and see this movie; if they tell you the truth, they won't sell any tickets...ï»¿"
looks like a great movie! lolol If I was back in America id see it. Dont judge if you havent seen it.... God i freakin hate Rotten Tomatoes.ï»¿

@SuperIce90 I've already been corrected but thanks ;)ï»¿
Great movie :) ï»¿
@SuperIce90 ok well I never watched it ^_^ no I wasn't joking I heard that on some other video which reviewed it ... but I'll take your word for it :D seems a bit like the bucket list though O_oï»¿
Now this is HD.ï»¿
you know it's a movie about bird watching O_oï»¿
@MuchDRACO 1:50ï»¿
I went with my three friends and we were the only teenagers in the theater. The rest were a bunch of old couples. This trailer is so misleading. Spoiler alert- It's a movie about watching birds. -_-ï»¿
Where's Jim Parsons?!ï»¿
This one of the most misleading trailers i have ever seen. I went to go see this movie and what this trailer doesn't tell you is that the entire plot is how the 3 guys put there lives on hold to try to spot as many birds as they can in a year. Totally unrelatable. Terrible movie. I know 100% that would not have got and seen it if i knewï»¿
honestly the worst fucking movie i have ever seen. i left the theatre it was terrible. did not laugh once in the hour i watched. fucking stupid plot and actors were not so great either. and i usually love all 3.... save your money peopleï»¿
.....BIRD FALLOUT.. lmaooo greatest thing ever. i die everytimeï»¿
"Good movie, jack black comes in second place with 741 birds, and Owen Wilson had 755, and jack black gets the girl dike from the office....spoiled the ending lolï»¿"
"This is a really good movie.Just cause it has high end actors doesn't mean it has to be the greatest thing ever made but if you go in with an open mind you'll find a lot more than just a comedyï»¿"
"So, my boyfriend and I went to the theater to see ""The Thing,"" turns out he forgot his ID... We ended up watching this movie. And you know what... I actually liked it. However, you really don't want to expect anything really big in the movie. I Loved the characters, even though Jack Black was played down a little. Honestly, this movie was really good in my eyes. The only thing I think people don't like about it, is the concept, birding.ï»¿"
Don't be deceived. This is THE WORST MOVIE of 2011. I fell asleep in the theatre out of boredom. Don't say you weren't told when you start crying in the theatre.ï»¿
WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER FUCKING SEEN THIS TRAILER MEANS NOTHING!!!ï»¿
PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY WITH THE MOVIE. It was not funny. It was a waste of both time and money. With a great cast I expected to laugh. It was simply stupid. Unless you really are into competitive bird watching. Two thumbs down and I want my $15 back! ï»¿
"This is a good film for all of you wondering.  The A - list actors did attract me to this movie, and I found much more than just another comedy flick.ï»¿"
@Imallsnow  Umm then they do ? obviestly . To use them for attraction. If you put people who arent so famous in it there wouldnt be as many viewers. Go play your lil nerd ass games & stfuu.ï»¿
"@Imallsnow Bro chill out  , i was just saying . & if its not a comedy you shouldnt put the funniest people in a lame un-comedy ass movie . They did it just for attention , which is how they got mine. Fuckkin faggettt.ï»¿"

Put in the funny stuuf and you say that you've seen all the good bits in the trailer. Leave out the funny stuff and people won't think it's funny or go see it. Guess the anwser is to have lots of funny stuff, i.e waaaaaaay more jokes that could ever fit into the trailer. Did hollywood ever think of that after the year 2000?ï»¿"
