"""please, save your money. this thing sucks."" hahaha sue cracks me up everytime :')ï»¿"
@TheBlueGrape you suck.ï»¿
The movie sucked.ï»¿
I didnt like the movie i hoped there will be more backstage scenes and stuff like that but honestly movie suckedï»¿

"One day Im going to be on glee and Im going to play the country girl who comes from Nashville Tenesee and blows people away with Carrie Underwood, Taylor Swift and the dixie Chicks, thats my dream come true and I will also date Rory lol my dream hudsbans... sigh....ï»¿"
"i was a bit disappointed. i watched it to see the actual concert. the stories were a bit annoying, and cut some of the songs i wanted to see. it seems they favourited blaine and britney alot. i wanted to see more of quinn, sam and tina.ï»¿"
"this was such a bad movie! i love love glee but the movie was just horrible! sue was right!ï»¿"
They should have totally done a movie with A plot. Not just a concert. :) I would totally watch it.ï»¿
Save your money. This thing sucks. Can't agree more.ï»¿

"I loved this movie but some of the scenes that happened in the trailer didn't actually happen in the movie, other than that I loved it.ï»¿"
"Definitely, Glee would suck without Sue XDï»¿"
"Probably the only reason I want to buy this movie is so I can pause it when they show shots of the crowd and then I can scan it for people wearing Starkid t-shirts. I have nothing against Glee, it's just I really want to see if there were any Starkids in the audience supporting Darren.ï»¿"
 Guess what magical DVD I got today? ;Dï»¿
Hangin out backstage... with HARRY FREAKIN POTTER!ï»¿
kurt and i ..i mean we run this whole ship hahaï»¿
"this movie needed more dianna agron, and when shes finally singing, u cant see the first seconds of the song because the other girl is talking, that sucks big time lolï»¿"
"I love Glee, and I was so excited to see the movie, but I miss to see the actors backstage. It was some short clips, and I would LOVE to see a little bit more of the Glee cast. Some funny moments or something. But anyway, it was still a good movie. :-)ï»¿"

This concert movie was very extraordinary. Seeing it in 3D with the awesome effects it really gave me the idea that I was part of the show that night. I really hope I can buy it on Dvd soon. ï»¿
"0:34 Mercedes looks awesome!0:47/0:48 Britanny too!ï»¿"
"Hah, actually just saw its quite a flop.Teach them a lesson to think people who watch glee would be into something like this. ï»¿"
"urhhhhh... why did they have to turn Glee into such a sucky thing (THANK YOU SUE) when the serie in itself rocks? Too much of a good just thing ruins it. But then again, they get more money off of teenage naÃ¯ve fans, so why would they care?ï»¿"

"I missed the running of it... For those that saw it, was Emma in at all? Because if she wasn't in the movie then I wouldn't've missed that much.ï»¿"
"i personally don't like the show that much, but the movie looks great! i'm gonna watch it.ï»¿"

@ThomasDilig623 wrong. 634 people actually listen to good music. this Glee shit is so fucking bad. they ruin songs by sing it them selfs. and its filled with a bunch of fucking douche bags and stuck up bitches. glee is an abomination to music. and so are you.ï»¿

kurt and i run this ship lol oh yes this film is awsome i love kurt ï»¿
"i saw this just to enjoy some catchy music and 3-D and it was really entertaining even though i am not a gleek, but never see this with a little 13 year old unmature bro because my brother walked out of the theater because of the kurt scenes and gay pride references!! lolï»¿"
I agree with the ugly gym teacherï»¿
son lo maximoï»¿
i got to see it and it was awsome ï»¿
Oh man! I have to wait just another week before it comes in the theaters here (Holland)! I want to see it NOW!!!! ;-)ï»¿
"just finish watching it. Damn NICE!!! Glee rocks!!ï»¿"
oh Sue... we all know you a secretly jealous of the New Directions. And Kurt's hair... <3333ï»¿
Gerlee..ï»¿
@DeltaSigChi4 finally you say something that makes sense....ï»¿
My friends are in this movie :)ï»¿
"Brittany: You wanna make out, Blaine?(Blaine raises an ewbrow as Kurt turns around)Kurt: BRITTANY, YOU HITTIN' ON MA MAN?!ï»¿"
@DeltaSigChi4 Finally you see how ridiculous your being... its about timeï»¿
Finally saw this today! :D it was awesome and amazing!ï»¿
"Harry Shum Jr's character started to get more popular, and I'm glad that he's gotten more lines, but now Jenna's character is getting hardly anything. In the Glee 3D movie, they showcased Lea Michelle way too much. I think Jenna and Amber Riely should have gotten more time in the Glee 3D Concert. I think Jenna only said one thing for 3 seconds during one song.ï»¿"
This is FAV movie everï»¿
"I've heard there's almost no klaine in it:(:(But I realy realy realy want to see it!!ï»¿"
"@DeltaSigChi4 What is your problem!? im stating MY COMMENT... on the COMMENT page... stop harassing me and no! for the last time, I could not make it to the MANY stops they did on the tour, i understand that people who bring up random accusations (you know what im talking about) are just depressed about the fact they lack a certain quality, so deal with me comment and mind your own bloody business.... ï»¿"
is it on in England yet? will it be at all?ï»¿
"@masterchiefphantom1 If you stayed after the slushie credits you would've seen Somebody to Love, they put it there cause it's like an ""encore"". My friends told me to stay after so that's how I knew! XD But once you get the DVD, you'll see it.ï»¿"
Is Jayma Mays and Mathew Morrison in the Movie?ï»¿
This is comming out on DVD right???ï»¿
Just watched the movie. It was awesome. And wow... Brrittany's boobs really DO look good in 3D.ï»¿
"Hey an other aussie fan out there who are disappointed by this film? before anyone jumps down my throat I just wanna say that it wasnt the performances that let me down in fact that was the saving grace of the film alone.BUT why did the interviews with the real life gleeks run into the performances? or why was the skit cut completely from the film? was it just us? or was it the same all round ï»¿"
"@DeltaSigChi4 Btw Australia is not an island it's a country you may want to catch up on your geography, and last i checked it's pretty hard for a 16 year old to move countries without parents so... got you there again and thirdly im over your ridiculous remarks im stating my opinon love it or leave itï»¿"
I HAVE TO SEE THAT !!!!! Confession of a proud GLEEK!! :DDï»¿
I watched it today and I thought it was EPIC. But that might just be me talkinï»¿
gonna watch it today!i hope i like it!ï»¿
"please, save your money, this thing sucks! oh sueï»¿"
i love it but i dont think it should be a concert movie ï»¿
I love it! <3ï»¿
I'm going 2 c it 2moz night yay with my mum ( let down lol) can't wait :D xx is it good?ï»¿
"Mr Shu wasn't on the tour because he was touring with his album and NKOTBBSB I think :)ï»¿"
@DeltaSigChi4 Okay first of all everyone is entitled to their own opinion and im stating mine... 2nd of all Glee doesnt come to australia so if you want to give me a couple of grand to visit america to see the show be my guest and thirdly they could have put all the songs in the movie and in order... so excuse youï»¿
Why wasn't Mr. Shu in the movie??ï»¿
"""Please...save your money...this thing sucks""Yep, I'm going to see it :Dï»¿"
90% of this trailer footage wasnt in the actual movie... rather disappointing... i believe they focused to much on those 3 people and not GLEE! and c'mon not all of the songs that were sang at the concert were even in the movie... im hoping glee comes back from the downwards spiral...ï»¿
i watched this movie 3 hours ago and it has made me a full on gleek <3 i love glee          ï»¿
"0:59 Sue Sylvester: Please, save your money. This movie sucks!Ironically, this movie has flopped bigtime! It debued at #11 on its opening weekend box office.So it looks like people took your advice Sue!ï»¿"
best movie everr!! i had so much fun watching it!!!ï»¿
"GOING TO SEE IT TOMORROW! WOOOP!ï»¿"
"I yam so gonna watch this shit. Yes, I yam.ï»¿"
"I loved Glee from the start, i was lucky enough to go and see the concert live in London. I'm not even ashamed to say i broke down in tears, it was absolutely fantastic. ï»¿"
I so wanna see this!ï»¿
I love Sue :Pï»¿
is single ladies in the movie??ï»¿
@Gta52010  glee is ace so don't bother insulting it cause u will be HATED!!!!ï»¿
Saw them live in Manchester at the M E N ARINA amazing really can sing absolutey fab!!!!!!!ï»¿
"...At the beginning, when Darren Criss is sitting around singing with the Warblers...there are Red Vines on the Table! :Dï»¿"

"I can't believe it....2,9 million views...only 500 000 bought tickets! 10 million average viewers per episode...only 500 000 bought tickets! A lot more viewers than Hannah Montana? But still cross more than glee? Everybody on glee has great voices even live? But still cross 5, 9 million? Somebody please explain?ï»¿"
heather is beautiful^_^ï»¿
@EP1KCAMPER personalities that they act out on a show. sorry if that's hard for you to comprehend.or are you mad that you are of a way lower life-form than some of the names that you posted?ï»¿
@larak551 its a free country I can say what the fuck I want. Its called an opinion. Primetime tv is just garbage now. I would rather watch fullhouse lol.ï»¿
"i mean im not gonna get caught walkin into the movies to c it lol, but i like the show. they should have just done this staight to dvd and went on tourï»¿"
i liked this movie :Dï»¿
Maybe if it was an actually broadway movie... it wouldve turned out better - not a concert movie .... wonder whose idea was thisï»¿
"so what if it wasnt in the top 10 , doesnt mean it wasnt a goood movie ! ï»¿"
LOL. This movie flopped so bad. Glad this fad is finally over.ï»¿
@tmla well they didn't flop they just ended :Lï»¿
@RBDHSMBELI Yeah 11th out of 20 really sucks even for a concert movie. Hannah montana and Justin Bieber concerts debuted at number 1. ï»¿
"Finally, Glee is floping! Can't wait for that shit to be over just like what happened with the jonas brothers and high school musical. ï»¿"
This message should be insterted in many other movie trailers: 0:58ï»¿
"I don't know what is worse, the Justin Bieber movie or this oneï»¿"
"I adore Glee. I really do. And I love music. ...But I honestly can't be bothered to watch a whole movie with JUST music. D; I really hope they'll make a real movie once, with an actual storyline! But maybe I'll rent this once, if nothing else than to ogle creepily at (Kurt & Blaine) everyone! c:ï»¿"
its just singing!? WTH... And i liked Glee....ï»¿
"Sue's right, it sucks.ï»¿"
"@TylightsOFFICIAL So you came onto youtube and this video JUST so you could bash it... looks like someone has no life. You say ugly girls and gay guys like it's a bad thing? To me, it looks like you're extremely insecure and take it out on other people/things to make yourself feel better. Take a look at yourself.ï»¿"
"@davidjedi115 If you don't like glee, then why did you search it on youtube and click on the trailer? Looks like someone needs to get a life... ï»¿"
i guess people followed sue's advice :)ï»¿
This show is for Mormons and my 68 year old mom ha ha this shit is garbage. And twilight sucks ass to. Go watch a real show like east  bound and Down. Fucking primetime tv garbage yuck city.ï»¿
@TylightsOFFICIAL And you just happened to magically end up on the trailer video?ï»¿
i saw itï»¿
"Dear Glee producers, when I paid my money for Glee Movie, I was expected to see Glee cast, not random people. You guys cut Lucky in Detroit concert, plus Diana and Chord only sang half of the song in every other concerts, and now, you cut half of the half song to show the audience about random people??? It's not fair for Detroit fans. And why you guys have to zoom in Kurt's face most of the time (example: Born this way)? I love Kurt, but it seems like he's kinda overrated in this movie.ï»¿"
Looks like more people watched the trailer instead of the actual movie lol..This has got to be the most annoying show in the history of television..Its so bad and the agenda behind the show is ridiculous...and not to mention Lea Michele looks like a dude..ï»¿
"@dylonrd its not in your channelï»¿"
I am not that familiar with Glee but I don't think it is too smart to have someone tell us that their movie sucks in the trailer. ï»¿
I hate myself a little for wanting to see this.ï»¿
"Im a straight girl, but Cory was right, Heather's (Britney) boobs are awesome in 3D! :Dï»¿"
this movie was so freakin amazing.ï»¿
Looks like most people took Jane Lynch's advice. The movie didnt even open in the Top 10. ï»¿
y here in the philippines its not showing ?ï»¿

And if you really gave up caring you would have spent the time to watch this video and comment on it AND reply to my comment so don't give me that bs. And of course the obligatory fake sarcastic smile :)ï»¿"
@jubbles23 Have a nice day!ï»¿
"@sageblast95 Hm? Sorry, I gave up with caring about what any of you Gleetards have got to say since, oh, I don't know, week 5 of the show. Mostly because you people have nothing intelligent to say :)ï»¿"

@UnrealStyrofoam Nope.avi :>ï»¿
Just got back from seeing it!!! It was pretty good! The only criticisms I have is that they jumbled the order of the songs (plus they cut a few!!) maybe it's because I saw the concert live and liked it better or what? And the little stories of fans in between songs I think is a bit much.... other then that it was good!!ï»¿
The Dublin One aint in it :( boooï»¿

"I watched it today. :3 It was great.And I read some recent comments... Seriously? You guys who post just to say it sucks... Do you have nothing better to do? Concentrate on what you LIKE, not what you dislike. A lot of people like Glee. It doesn't make a difference if you hate it. It's a freaking show. A show that a lot of people find inspiration in and enjoy... You're entitled to your opinion, just don't shove it in everyone's face to tell them they shouldn't like it.ï»¿"

This show is truly the best thing that's ever graced television, despite it's a bunch of singing, and a bunch of teenage bullshit drama that has received it's cue from, oh I don't know countless High School crap? Taking songs from established artists and re-performing them, and yet people call it an original show? Inspired? It's songs that are shit to begin with, and a group of people make it just as shitty, or slightly better than they once were.ï»¿"

So I counted down the days til the concert from the day I got the tickets. I'd never been more excited about anything! Then when the day came we got there early to meet the stars. we met the Warblers except Darren. Then I got super sick with a 104 fever & threw up. I couldn't stop shaking the rest of the night & felt like I had to pass out. I'm so sad because watching this I know couldn't even comprehend what was going on during the concert. My most exciting day of my life I don't even rememberï»¿
Ooo ohmygod i love the Warblers! theyre all sooo cute:) and AMAZING singersï»¿

"I'm just sick of those people who come here to insult Glee and just don't get why they made a Concert movie. Many artists made that (Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus, Michael Jackson, ...) because of their success and so the fans who couldn't go to their concerts can see them like their were there (that's why it's in 3D). And I think this is great, because I think every fan should get the chance to see a concert of their favorite singers/bands.ï»¿"
"@minnimacnjordskii this is not never say neverï»¿ all over again! That movie totally sucks. I didn't watch it but I know it sucks because Bieber sucks. But Glee doesn't.

"@CloverTheHedgehog23 It's not about making music, it's about plot lines and characters that I love. I don't watch it because I love the music, and all the fans of Glee I know admit that the songs suck, but they are good singers and good actors and it's a really good show!ï»¿"

"Nice use of reverse psychology, Sue!!!ï»¿"
The point of this movie is to see the cast that we love doing what they love. You get to see behind the scene footage of what they do backstage when you obviously can't do the same at the actual concert.ï»¿

@easyvintage They don't take issues like sexting or drinking seriously. That was one of the things I really didn't appreciateï»¿
"Why are you guys thinking that it's a joke? I would actually SHUT UP if I were you guys cause if you didn't notice, Glee has had a LOT of fans and have achieved many things: Five Glee albums have hit platinum or gold status, 106 songs have been in Billboards Hot 100 AND the cast members performed a sold-out tour. Have you done that? No. So, stop being asses and just be happy for them. Or if you just don't like Glee, then why don't you just search a video which you will actually enjoy to watch.ï»¿"

Sue is right. This thing does suck. I thought the show was bad.....ï»¿
"I agree with Jane Lynch...,.ï»¿"
@easyvintage On the contrary. I used to be a fan of 'Glee'; watched it religiously. I can't really see what the fuss was now. I'm totally switched off the show. I just couldn't believe a film was coming out. Curiosity  got the better of me.ï»¿
