I live in Texas about an hour from where the chainsaw massacre happenedï»¿
Elijah Munson they never happened!? Its not a true story!!ï»¿
God what a fucking moronï»¿
He's either talking about Ed Gein or the place where the movie was filmedï»¿
I actually dont understand how a few adults run away from a guy that didnt have a gun just a chainsaw they could defeat them if they work togetherï»¿
actually if they didn't have a gun it would be incredibly hard for even 10 people to stop one man wih a chainsaw. not to mention regular peopleï»¿
This Leatherface chap was huge and easily overpowered most adults.ï»¿
hitman agent47 welcome to slasher movies bro... you must be new.ï»¿

"You really want to know how to put an end to these types of movies - stop paying to see them in the theaters and you won't be subjected to watching them on You Tube or any other social media outlet because if they suck that badly in movie theaters they'll finally get the message and stop making them altogether.  But young generations are too damn addicted to them for Hollywood to quit so they think ""Hey these young audiences complain about how bad these films suck yet they continue to supporting them and putting money in our pockets. We're super rich because of them they make us rich while we keep making them - we can't suck that bad so let's continue making more and more.""  And so they do. Your money is power start using that power.ï»¿"
how many movies does it take for the fuckin chainsaw to run out of gas.ï»¿
yea leave people alone u ugly fat man!ï»¿
LMMFAO!!!!! Truthï»¿

"I... I think, don't quote me on this, but I think he means; why did Heather live while everyone else died. I think. I dunno.ï»¿"
+Crow Jane i think he meant that women always live longer than the menï»¿
"@Aiden Flavell dude...in the words of queen""Who wants to live forever?"" haha...references..ï»¿"

@Anni Lyn game grumps?ï»¿
@Aiden Flavell yeah...Dan quoted queen..look it upï»¿
"movie rules: the girl always survives, the hot chick and the dudes die. however, in Friday the 13th Tommy Jarvis survived 3 films and Jared Padalecki survived the remake so that was niceï»¿"
"Can someone explain to me how this is better than the original? How this is one of the best horror movies ever made? How this movie is getting a sequel? This movie was shit! The characters were unlikeable and the script was shitty. Fuck, I would rather watch Texas Chainsaw: The Next Generation. Oh and one more thing....if the girl they saved at the beginning is Heather and she was saved in the 70's how is she like 19....she should be in her 40's.ï»¿"
Where did you hear this? NO ONE thinks this movie is better than the original!?ï»¿
"@venman88 Oh, you would be suprised how often I hear this from peopleï»¿"
@I am super serious well... their wrong Â ï»¿
@venman88 I knowï»¿
Isn't better than original but this is good too storyline is interesting.ï»¿
I enjoyed the beginning when they gunned down the family after that it's crapï»¿
"Just gonna say it...they all started to suck REALLY BAD after number two. Really, you can't compare to the original...ï»¿"
"I consider ""The next generation"" and ""3D"" to be the only bad onesï»¿"
The first one is always the best i guess... :)ï»¿
FacelessTex not always ..but in the Texas chainsaw franchise yes!!ï»¿
"a true embarrassment to the franchise. wtf were they thinking. ""DO YOUR THING CUZ""ï»¿"
Nothing is more cringe worthy than an unlikeable character saying a stupid one liner. Leave all the one liners to Ash William!ï»¿
"Stop making remakes and silly follow ups to a horror film that was genuinely horrendous please, u yanks are fucking backwards anyway, stop ruining a classic u fucking clownsï»¿"
THE. Only reason everyone want to see this movie is because the thick white girl and trey songsï»¿
heerlijkï»¿
"So Leatherface is a senior citizen chasing them on a walker? I always found it amusing how he had such good luck keeping his chainsaw running and starting it so easily. I never can get mine to do that, I would make a terrible Leatherface for that reason.ï»¿"
you r so funny....ï»¿
they fuck this movie up big timeï»¿
"another stupid "" horror "" remake,ï»¿"
It's not a remake.  it's a sequelï»¿
@Aiden Flavell lol noooo. It's a sequel to the original Texas chainsaw massacre made in the 50s. Not the 2005 remakeï»¿
@YouTube Commentsâ€‹ Never knew there was a 2005 version ï»¿
2003 my bad ï»¿
"the 70s, not the 50s. the 03 remake had a prequel in 2006 tooï»¿"
"A chainsaw is really a very impractical weapon. They can weigh over 25 lbs, and are able to hurt you if they actually touch you, which means the assailant has to be swinging a big heavy object, while it's running, at you. Unless you're tied to a tree or something, you'll probably never get hit.ï»¿"
My uncle can swing a chainsaw one handed.ï»¿
This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen with a major glaring plot hole: The main character in this film is shown as a baby during the events that took place with Leatherface and his family in 1974 and this film is set in 2012 which would make the girl 38 years old and Leatherface should either be dead or an old man.... So why the fuck is the girl shown as a TEENAGER and Leatherface doesn't seem to have aged one bit and can still run like he did 38 years ago?! Absolutely lazy writing which proves that the makers of this film clearly don't care about it so why the hell should we.....ï»¿

+sam moffatt The film is set in 2002 you fucking idiot.ï»¿
On her grandmas gravestone in the film it says she died in 2013. Also if the film is set in 2002 then how come the girl is seen in the film holding an Iphone (which didn't come out until way after 2002) YOU fucking idiot......ï»¿
+Commander Foxtrot don't forget the cop had an iPhone 4 or 5 face timing a cop showing dead bodies _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
+sam moffatt I could not agree more this movie was fucking shitï»¿
"Oh my god, so trueï»¿"
The first movie is the best.ï»¿
no they are showing what happened on that day just for people who never seen it beforeï»¿
the first leatherface ever played this oneï»¿
"@Khalil JohnsonHe did in fact played one of Leatherface's family members. He died a year ago, R.I.Pï»¿"
maybe the film is not set in 2013ï»¿
sam moffatt maybe because it's a fucken movieï»¿
Jacob Dominguez So? Movies need to be consistent too.ï»¿
sam moffatt i fucking disagree th9 2013 was good and so as the other movie'sï»¿
Khalil Johnson not true..he had a small part but it was not letherfaceï»¿
Jacob Dominguez that's the stupidest answer ever!!??ï»¿
Just your opinion i loved itï»¿
@Robert Willetts really!? ...it was total garbage;? Lolï»¿
In this movie the black one died :Dï»¿
Spoiler alert manï»¿
He's treysongz...ï»¿
+Cindy Ruiz who caresï»¿
venman88 WTF #Blacklivesmatterï»¿
"Still disturbed that this was even released in theaters only 2 weeks after 20 innocent kids lost their lives in the Sandy Hook massacre, by a psychopath with a weapon. THE LAST thing I'd want to see at that time was a movie about a psychopath with a weapon killing slightly older innocent kids...Apparently I was the only one since this was #1 at the Box Office....GO DESENSITIZATION.ï»¿"
"Clearly you were, there was nothing wrong that this was release two weeks after; just a coincidence.ï»¿"
"Sandy Hook was a hoax, you gullible piece of shit.ï»¿"
@Jai CourvoisierÂ yes and so was 9/11 we've heard it ALLLL before.ï»¿
"@Bryce JamesÂ I know it was a coincidence since the movie was already filmed obviously, but when it was #1 at box office I was like ""damn really?""It was a mix of two things that made me not want to see it....1) I felt sickened by all the violence we are so used to that it's basically just another occurance these days.2) the fact that this movie looked terrible...and was not only a SEQUEL...but a sequel to a REMAKE.Makes me believe that in 2085, theyre will be a 3rd sequel to a remake of The Godfather.ï»¿"
I have the original Texas Chainsaw. Haven't seen this version.ï»¿
"+Sara Rose Keep it that way, why bother see this version if you have the much better original, and all this is...is a sequel...to a remake...in 3D. So basically EVERY gimmick in the book to try and get people to pay for tickets.ï»¿"
You're luckyï»¿
god awfulï»¿
CatMadShea yes sums it up perfectly!!!ï»¿
So the comments on this being a remake for the new generation are wrong this takes place after the original 1974 ï»¿
Who's love the end meï»¿
Who's watching this in 2015 ? Meï»¿
Who was watching this in 2013 ?_Ÿ˜ƒ_Ÿ˜Å_Ÿ˜„_Ÿ˜œï»¿

"Lionsgate, just hear me out !...Let ""Eli Roth"" to direct next Texas Chainsaw movie with his own gore style.The outcome would be fantastic, as far as I concern. Just think ""bout it...ï»¿"
"Tell me about it... Huge disappointment...!Â ï»¿"
I watched this and I am still scared ï»¿
How hard is it to shoot the guy?ï»¿
