Very funny and sad at the same time...ï»¿
Amazing movie. Woody Allen = Oscar. Cate Blanchett was extraordinary in this movie.ï»¿
This was definitely one of Cate Blanchettâ€™s strongest performancesï»¿
Masterpieceï»¿
Iâ€™m thinking is it time trump has to do something with Hollywood...ï»¿
"I really didn't like this movie :( Woody Allen is either hit or a total miss,  usually 1 hit for every few misses, but this one was definitely a miss for meï»¿"
Cate Blanchett really can speak in so many different tones of voice and accents I'm baffled at her talentï»¿
"This is very much like A Streetcar Named Desire, except a lighter version.ï»¿"
alina rabani thank you I thought Iâ€™m the only oneï»¿
"Thanks for the comment! :) I absolutely love A Streetcar, both as text and film.ï»¿"
And not since Tennesee Williams has a writer reached the level of character depiction as Allen does in this masterpiece.The faded...near insane aging beauty.Cate is a modern day version of Blanche Dubois to the hilt.ï»¿
"@1994g0 So who would you classify Stanley Kowalski in the scenario, Louis C K, Dice, Gyp Rosetti?ï»¿"
Louis CK.ï»¿
"Woody Allen writing this makes absolutely every character in the movie sound like Woody Allen. The run-on sentences, the constant incohesice banter. The main character is Woody in a middle-aged, blonde female body.ï»¿"
CONGRATULATIONS!! You've summarized Woody's entire writing career. Almost ALL his mains talk like this.ï»¿
Fabulous!! Juste en bas de mÃ¡ ruelle. Je lâ€™aime. Exquis!ï»¿
terrible trailer. but this might be a perfect movie. I've seen it 3 or 4 times now and its always extremely entertaining and stimulating.ï»¿
This was an incredible movie but jesus christ is it depressing!ï»¿
Omg Elisa can talk _Ÿ’–_Ÿ’–ï»¿
"Brilliant film!!! Great cast, script and the master Woody Allen!!ï»¿"
This is one movie I don't understand yetï»¿
Cate performance is so GREAT! OVER the top!ï»¿

"Oh chÃ©rie, je crains que quelques-uns ont dÃ©jÃ  fait queï»¿"
another movie about narcissism and histrionics. Exactly like Blance in Streetcar named desireï»¿
"She was absolutely amazing in this movie.,,ï»¿"
superb cast and acting. enjoyed this movie a lot and watched it againï»¿
I love cateï»¿
Based on A Streetcar Named Desire?ï»¿
it is!ï»¿
"A movie about two crazy manipulative sisters, quite good if your looking for such a thing, but otherwise its very meh.ï»¿"
"Allen's best movie in years. And Blanchett, OMG, what a performance! Kudos to Sally Hawkins too...ï»¿"
"Not sinceÂ  Tennessee Williams placed his indelible mark on the theater has there a movie or play with such deep psychological insights as ""Blue Â Jasmine"".Kudos to Cate and Woody for creating this work of genius Loved the music too.ï»¿"
Depressing.....ï»¿
"I love the movie, but the ending... Hmp I'm not satisfied. So she became fully insane in the end?? ï»¿"
"Yes she did. ""There's only some many traumas a person can withstand before they go crazy""- Jasmine. She hit her final strawï»¿"
