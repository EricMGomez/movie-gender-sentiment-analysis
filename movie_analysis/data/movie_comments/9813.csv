"really weird, twisted movie. But I actually loved it, people always want to avoid the dark shit but this movie shows it and shows what people have to deal with and what people think aloud. pretty deep and underrated. (2018)ï»¿"
This movie is sooooooooo underratedï»¿
REALLY BEAUTIFUL GIRLS IN THIS FILMï»¿
"She wasn;t even deaf, Â I knew it! What a disgusting movie though. If I had known that this movie had so much incest in it like the scene of the Father having sex with his own daughter, I wouldn't have watched it. I feel so dirty for watching the whole thing. Only a totalÂ perv would really enjoy this movie.ï»¿"
+slapstickaction thank you for ruining the movieï»¿
douchebagï»¿
slapstickaction   You are an idiot!!!!! I am so  pissed with you right now.ï»¿
kmï»¿
"is a good movie c: it's not the movie of the year,..but is goodï»¿"
This film is so much more intense and twisted then you could possibly imagine from the trailer.ï»¿
+Greg Fox I had no idea it was that sick and twisted. I wish someone would have warned me that it was so disgusting. I don&#39;t like seeing a father having sex withÂ with hisÂ own teenage daughter.ï»¿
"Where can i watch/rent this movie? I tried looking on Amazon videos but i cant find it. ._.""ï»¿"

The part with her dad is messed upï»¿
It's funny to see Alex from Happy Endings and Victoria from Mike&Molly as cheerleaders :Dï»¿
I loved the parts where Connor is interested in Dot. So hearthwarming to see the seemingly jerk jock's sensitive side.ï»¿
noï»¿
UGH great...... now I cant sleep having to watch it in netflix makes my brain more TWISTED!! O.O weirdest shit! I've seen today. but anyways....how come there's some deleted scenes?or am i hallucinating? O.Oï»¿
The trailer makes this movie seem less weird than it really is. It's a trapï»¿
Literaly every caractar in this movie was twisted as fuck. Its such a weird fucking movie but strangly it makes u wanna see what is going to happen.ï»¿
one of my fave movies for sureï»¿
It's really a great movie!ï»¿
What school? how did you like the movie?ï»¿
weirdest shit i have ever seenï»¿
I feel sorry for everyone. Exept Michelle...ï»¿
Camilla Belle's best performance.ï»¿
no why the fuck would i be joking its a good movie ï»¿
"seriously ?what school, where ï»¿"
this movie is so underratedï»¿
yes :(ï»¿
"it's so sad and all too common with all types of abuse - domestic, family violence, sexual abuse, rape, incest, etc :( the victims rarely get any justice and are often on the recieving end of a lot of negativity from so many ignorant and hateful people who sympathise with the perpetrators.it's a sick, sad world we live in :( ï»¿"
True. Thank you :D I hate how they don't believe the kid. and then when they ask the adult the truth and don't put him/her in jail. Then the kid would probably get beaten for tellingï»¿
"oh yeah definitely, but at the same time, authorities need to begin taking victims seriously.ï»¿"
"I know, but still. anyone that is getting raped by anyone should turn them in.ï»¿"
"(part 2) plus, if you were being raped from a young age systematically by someone who should be keeping you safe, you'd probably be angry enough to contemplate murder.lastly, just turning him in wouldn't have made for an interesting movie.ï»¿"
"people are not kind to victims of rape and sexual abuse, unfortunately. many victims feel ashamed and that's what the perp banks on for them to not tell anyone. she was trying to get money together to run away but her dad found out and tried to rape her in the movie. so she had no easy options.and with her mother turning a blind eye to the abuse, she prob felt no one would believe her.ï»¿"
Well she should have reported him.ï»¿
"have you even seen the movie? did you even watch the trailer? she wants to kill her dad for it. she even said it in the trailer lolthe only disgusting person in the movie is her evil fucked up fatherï»¿"
"Okay, but if she thinks incest is normal. She is disgusting.ï»¿"
i disagree...ï»¿
No. She is fucked. Up.ï»¿
"SPOILER: glad the pervert dad got what was coming to him.ï»¿"
not really. pretty normal response when someone's doing something that heinous to you.ï»¿
GREAT ASS MOVIEï»¿
Thank you.ï»¿
Can someone explain this movie to me properly. i've seen it but tbf i don't really get it. i'm not gonna say anything because it will ruin it for everyone else but does anyone wanna explain it fully to me...?ï»¿
well said.ï»¿
Camilla Belle ;)ï»¿
Horrible fucking movie.ï»¿
I thought that the girl who played Dot was kinda pretty.ï»¿
i remember this movie :3 i remember watching it when i was 13 or something and my parents who were in the room were like 'WHAT IS THIS!? YOUR GROUNDED FOR WATCHING THIS FILTH!!'...even though i watch antichrist with them..but yeah amazing movieï»¿
That blonde girl is fucked up.ï»¿
"And, unless you are a film student or an accomplished screenwriter or director, who are you to say you could make a better movie?ï»¿"
"A movie can't make someone suicidal. It's like saying The Catcher In the Rye made Mark David Chapman kill John Lennon. It can make you ponder different themes that make you question how they connect to your own life, and those connections can make your depressed. However, a movie cannot be made responsible for a person wanting to end their life. That has to have been inside a person before the movie triggered it.ï»¿"
Only in movies do you see people making fun of those who are disabled... ï»¿
"Rofl ich auchï»¿"
Ich bin hier nur durch ProSieben :Dï»¿
"The film made me suicidal. It's the worst shit you will ever see. I could direct a film when playing with my left nut, and still make it more entertaining. Fucking bad movie. Never watch it!ï»¿"
"i can definitely agree with you on that. The description would have played out better in a book, therefore giving it more life and a better adaptation on screenï»¿"
nyce sceneï»¿
elisha cuthbert was hot as hell on this filmï»¿
"i thought it was so...so...weird. maybe disturbing is the word. yeah. and things happen so slow. i wish it had a book! but anyway, i thought it was an ok movie....i expected more between both of the girls, as in frienship wise. at least more talking! i felt i had to yell to make them talk, lol! ï»¿"
"Even though it's a pretty good movie, it's still really fucked up and kinda disturbing...ï»¿"
This movie was shot at my school! :Dï»¿
Diffently a must watch movie. Kinda disturbing in some place but you won't regret watching it. ï»¿
"The movie is better then the trailer. I love this movie sooo much, it is so beautiful. :)ï»¿"
"@TheeMonkeyGirl is Camilla Belleï»¿"
Quiero verla!!..ï»¿
"me encanta ï»¿"
the girl with short hair is prettyï»¿
"Oh my god!! Whom do i choose ?? Elisha Cuthbert or Camilla Belle ?? Screw it, I LOVE THEM BOTH!! ï»¿"
"@eugenewatanakoon Oh I see, thanks for the explanation. I feel bad for her mother.  Good movie though. One of the best with twisted ending I've ever seen :Dï»¿"
Great performances! More films like this need to be made and Hollywood should take notice!ï»¿
"@Boris19ful This is also Elisha Cuthbert at her best -- acting, appearance, etc.ï»¿"
"@cliffto6 No, her mom has no mental problems. Remember that the husband always gives her some sort of drug before getting to bed? That makes her (the mom) mind blank and out of condition for the rest of the night. She said that she was the one who murdered her husband because she can't remember anything that happened. She was in the room when with her dead husband when she came into her senses, making her think that she was the one who killed her husband, out of awareness.ï»¿"
"Can someone describe what happens in the movie? in a message, i dont want to spoil the movie for othersï»¿"
"I watched it on tv, but they cut so many scenes so I got confused. what happened to Nina's mom? Is she has a mental problem? Because she admit that she kills her husband, or it just the way she to protect her daughter?ï»¿"
protect her daughterï»¿
i dont know why i like this movie so much. it was on tv the other night and i really wanted to go to bed but i just couldnt stop watching it. i think i might need to go buy it lol ï»¿
@ilenization Lmao nice trollï»¿

"great moviealso what is the name of the song at 1:32?ï»¿"
I Just finish watching this movie it's a good movie but I am a bit confuse. But I like the movie 4.5 starsï»¿
@Over9000Penises27 the blond is having sex with the dad...the other girl pretends to be deaf and she was adopted by the blond's parents...but the blond knows she's not deaf.ï»¿
It's a great movie...I wanna watch it again....but I need more courage~~ï»¿
Elisha Cuthbert and Camilla Belle two of the most beautiful women ever. i must wach this movie !!! ï»¿
"I just saw this movie. Definitely worth watching, and just like the previous commenter, I really enjoyed the music in it.ï»¿"
i remember seeing this movie and it's fuxing a-some! Especially hearing some of the classical works! I think moonlight sonata is played too. And any movie with moonlight sonata is epic WIN!ï»¿
best movie ever<33ï»¿
Worst movie ever! Pretty good acting but a terrible plot .ï»¿
"Not her sister, she is taken in by the blondes family and cant hear or talk.ï»¿"
"is that blonde banging her own DAD?!ï»¿"
"@thelolpanther really? if she knew her dad and her sister were having sex together, why couldn;t she write down on paper, i'm only judging from the trailer thoughï»¿"
It's Rinoa :Dï»¿
i kinda liked this movieï»¿
@crossxfuse I know she's AMAZING looking!!ï»¿
whatever guy that wouldn't want to be with that girl has to be gayï»¿
the film is way better than this stupid trailer... ï»¿
Camilla Belle's acting in this is surprisingly good - in fact - I'd say it's one of her best performances. ï»¿
O lucky fatherï»¿
great movie...i watched him yasterday :Dï»¿
"Very good movie. Directed, acted and written perfect. Elisha ruls ;).ï»¿"

"Elisha Cuthbert is Always BeautifulSHES THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL ON THE WHOLE PLANET !!ï»¿"
Elisha Cuthbert IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL ON THE WHOLE PLANETï»¿
"You are Wrongg !! Elisha is soooooo much Hotter than camillla!ELISHA CUTHBERT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL ON THE WHOLE PLANET!!ï»¿"
That Blonde Girl has a Name ( Elisha Cuthbert )    Not raped ! they just had sex! but she dont want it ! So she wanna kill her dad!ï»¿
i saw it on Youtube ! its pretty easy to foundï»¿
nopeï»¿
any lesbian kisses?ï»¿
they look like twins.i couldn't recognize who is whoï»¿
"baltimoreblitz16 - It wasn't a fight with her parents gone wrong. He was sexually abusing her, even if she seemed very willing, and she couldn't take it anymore. She wasn't sick, he was, for wanting and doing that with his own daughter. This is what most people would call an extreme, and very distressing, situation.ï»¿"
This movie surprised me when I saw it on cable. I admit my intentions on watching this was to se Elisha Cuthbert but it turned out to be a good movie. I'm blown because I read yesterday that they had a lesbian scene between Nina and Michelle.ï»¿
"Camilla Belle is so awesome in this movie, one of my top 5 movies, i give it a 10/10ï»¿"
This movie is good.ï»¿
Hot movie. One of my all time favourites.ï»¿

"One of my favorite movies!Interesting story plot.....ï»¿"
"What is called the music that touches dot on the piano in the movie?Â¿Como se llama la musica que toca dot en el piano en la pelicula?ï»¿"
"she dont get raped, she has sex with her own dad only when she lied she got raped. but is a goooddd movieï»¿"

"Same here, LOL.ï»¿"
I have to see this movie!ï»¿
Watched it with my mom but then I had to leave the room. lolï»¿
I was a wierd movie but i loved itï»¿
"This is the weirdest movie I've ever seen.But it is incredibly good in it's own special way.My way of distinguishing a good movie. - It is so different that I don't want to watch it - I can't stop watching it because it's so different.ï»¿"
"Good movie, I really like it. Great performace from Camilla Belle (love it) and elisha (Im not a fan from her, but she did really good). The script is great. For me the thriller was the character of Dot, awesome acting camilla!!!ï»¿"
awesome movie!! great performace from elisha as always...ï»¿

"duh, I watched this movie, I know Elisha was hot, but after watched it, camilla was even hotter, she totally blow away Elisha in this movie.ï»¿"
"My god ... i want to see this too =D Elisha is a some pretty girl ... always ...ï»¿"
Is she doing her own dad there????ï»¿
Elisha looks great but the film looks like it belongs more to Camilla Belle.  A far more accomplished actress who gives me a reason to watch this film.ï»¿
dude i hope she kisses that girlï»¿
WOW!..at last she return again to good movies (camilla) ..ooo..shawn is hot!..this gonna be a great moviie=)..cant wait to see it;)ï»¿
I want to see this!:D Elisha looks really good in it! I think her dad is sexually abusing Elisha's character. I hope Elisha doesn't kiss another girl in that one scene.ï»¿
