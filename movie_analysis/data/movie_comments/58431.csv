This movie is badassï»¿
what is a name for this music?ï»¿
"KMFDM - ,,these boots are made for walking""ï»¿"
arya S  thank youï»¿
Scaryï»¿
The movie seems stupid but it is actually realllyyyyy good.ï»¿
"This version of the story took out the yawns from the original story, left the romance, varied the humor, and added zombies.A very enjoyable reboot of a classic story, and with reasonable run-time, too. (Oh, the length of the P&P BBC miniseries! groans)ï»¿"
i prefer this over the original versionï»¿
I just got a semiï»¿
I want the song on my playlistï»¿
"great movie, shitty trailer.ï»¿"
The best thing about this is that they used a KMFDM song.ï»¿
NO puedo creer que Lily James se preste para esta basura!ï»¿
Poor Jane Austen.......ï»¿
the only thing that is good in this movie is douglas booth tbhï»¿
This is the most retarded thing I have ever heard of.ï»¿
dafuq is dis?ï»¿
PG 13 killed it lolï»¿
More Feminist Propaganda. I've seen the movie online and it Blows lol.ï»¿
I thought this movie would be so stupid but I just finished watching it and it's actually really goodmï»¿
"Lol Japan can make a better zombie love drama movie by adding hot half naked girls, tentacles, and possibly bush.ï»¿"
High School of the Deadï»¿
if you love real zombie movies then this movie is not for you if your a teen who came to watch the sexy and handsome girls and guys then you will enjoy this shitï»¿
Did this movie make any kind of money at the box office?ï»¿
it was a super flopï»¿
WTF???ï»¿
super duper awesomeï»¿
superï»¿
hell to the F no man!!!!!!ï»¿
"sooo ""zombie"" word exist along time ago, huh.ï»¿"
so out of touch zombies is just over shotï»¿
"I watched it today on showbox , this movie is awesomeï»¿"

I don't remember learning this in English literature. lolï»¿
"""My daughters were trained for battle... Not the kitchen"" what I would say as a future father.ï»¿"

CÃ¡c vi thÃ¢n aicÃ¢pï»¿
Nice trailer like watching assasin creed trailer..ï»¿
Cinderella gone wildï»¿
song by KMFDM :Dï»¿
I JUST WATCHED THIS MOVIE AND ITS A REALLY GOOD MOVIE HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDï»¿
A bit disappointing. For some reason I kinda had an expectation for it. It didn't deliver for me.ï»¿
Please don't insult the 'Pride and prejudice'ï»¿
I thought the pg-13 rating was a joke...ï»¿
Wearing a corset would make it 10 times more difficult to kill zombies... and you would probably faint in the first 10 minutes of battle due to it crushing your organs and lungsï»¿
"You're thinking Victorian corsetry, which is totally different from the Regency. Regency corsetry was more akin to a push-up bra than a girdle--its purpose was to lift the breasts, not adjust the gut, as Regency fashions lacked a natural waistline. There was no need of tight lacing, or even long stays, so these corsets would be quite comfortable and easy to move in.The lightweight fabric and side-slits common in Regency apparel would also aid in freedom of movement. (But they'd be pretty cold for outdoor fighting.)ï»¿"
This movie is awesomeï»¿
"Is this....a Comedy?ï»¿"
Lol same thoughts :Dï»¿
@mistaÂ :Dï»¿
"Kind of, actually...ï»¿"
Don't knock it until you see it for yourselves! It was surprisingly good! I recommend it!ï»¿
i'ved never actually read the book because i can't see my precious p&p turned to p&p&zombies. like wtf. but am not entitled to give comments less i read it... trailer looks kinda good thoï»¿
great movie.i love it._Ÿ˜„ï»¿
Lily James amazing âù_ï¸èï»¿
Was that Matt smith !!ï»¿
this is so weirdï»¿
I just watched this movie earlier well for me its okey. Actually I understand and its good mybe they still has a part two.ï»¿
after the box office flop I don't think there will be any part 2ï»¿
Don't waste your time on this movie ! All the action is in the trailer! It's also  predictable and storyline is all over the place!ï»¿
it was awesome!!!!ï»¿
was planning to watch this bcoz of Lily James and did a second look on this trailer and finally decided that im breaking up with Lily babe...ï»¿
Dr. Who was that?ï»¿

Perhaps Movie in future releases...1.Queen Victoria: Demon Hunter....Sexy Gothic British Warrior in India2.Henry VIII Wolfman....He kill Furrie...3.Another Prequel: Dawn of the Dreadfuls...Resident Evil/House of the Dead set in Victorian Era U.K4.Move Under Ground....Very Good Idea 5.The Last American Vampire....Joseph Joestar as guest.6.Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monster......WHY7. Android Karenina...Anime Punk Romanticï»¿
"its pg 13 because this movie is meant to be a comedy,  the trailers just shit.go watch the british trailer it portrays the movie betterï»¿"
Saw this last night n loved it can't wait to see it again _Ÿ˜œï»¿
SUKI!!!!!ï»¿
I watched this movie today and it was great.ï»¿
"I saw this last night. I didn't read the book ""Pride & Prejudice & Zombies"" yet but my friend who read it said they're was only two chapters missing & they were about the younger sisters going away to train otherwise the movie kept to the book (yes there is a book out there of the exact title that this movie is based on & it was the same author of ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" who specializes in taking time periods & familiar things & giving them supernatural twists). It was a solid movie. Made me laugh & jump & the action sequences were really good. Lily James & Sam Riley were entertaining together but Lily could definitely hold her own. I wish Lena Heady's character was more involved because SHE was awesome. Matt Smith was a really good comic relief. The movie wasn't too gory & there was no swearing or blatant nudity so I can see where they kept the PG-13 rating. I would give the movie a 7.5/10.ï»¿"
"The movie is fine, I saw it today! There was a sceneÂ in which theÂ leadingÂ woman attacked the leading male character because she disagreed of something he did. I do not like it because it promotes violence on men from women. Many women thought it was cool but for me, that's the reason the American society is a mess and more women are violent!ï»¿"
"Great, another classic song ""re-imagined"" (and subsequently destroyed) for a film trailer. When will this trend go away? Stop being lazy and doing the same old obvious thing, people.ï»¿"
"I just realized that the same actress who played the live action version of last years Cinderella plays the main actress in this movie...I think next year we're gonna get the same actress playing in ""Cinderella vs Zombies"". I'd watch it. :Dï»¿"
I don't care who thinks this movie is going to suck. So far it looks good.ï»¿
Cinderella gone badï»¿
Wow.. unbelievable...              move over force awakens.ï»¿
coming soon gone with the witchesï»¿
Is anyone else watching this movie just for Matt Smith?ï»¿
cant wait to watch it....ï»¿
Seriously? Hahahahaï»¿
Is nothing sacred anymore :(ï»¿
I read the book in High School. Based of of Jane Austin by another Author. Forgot the author.ï»¿
HELLO.  IT'S ASTONISHKNG WIPE SWIFT WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ABOUT%THISï»¿
"I just got an ad for this movie as I'm about to watch the trailer for this movie, wtf!!?ï»¿"
"It's stupendout What's up, guys. crawl sassy # !ï»¿"
jane Austen is gonna cry if he saw this....or come back alive as zombie and eat the director's brain...ï»¿

"Next up, Thomas Edison, and Nikola Tesla in myth hunters.ï»¿"
matt smith _Ÿ˜çï»¿
This is unbelievably stupid. A zombie movie makes sense. But adding Pride and Prejudice? Are they trying to reach a new audience???ï»¿
Cinderella became Buffy huh ? Let's see~ï»¿
looks good...i think i might watch it.... but... im not sure about the guy they picked for Darcy :( he's cute but he has too much of a baby face to look bad ass... i hope his acting will suffice.ï»¿
"They're all trained for battle, but they look soft as daisies and have no scars on their faces?ï»¿"
"This whole concept is extremely stupid,but WHY DO I LIKE IT SO MUCH?!?  Gonna watch this, canâ€ùt even lie...ï»¿"
I love Lily James so I'll watch this..hahaï»¿
Omg this looks awesome!!!!!ï»¿
"I hope this will take the route of 'Hansel & Gratel: Witch hunters' and be sort of a funny badass film, instead of taking itself too seriously.ï»¿"
Well this looks nice!!!ï»¿
"At first it looked cool, but than I seen the ad over and over and over again so now it just looks retarded thanks YouTube _Ÿ˜‘ï»¿"

LOL trueï»¿
"Actually, the movie is based on a book... so yeah _Ÿ˜‚ï»¿"
It's a comedy. Some idiot decided to market it as an action film.ï»¿
"When you get an ad trailer to the same exact trailer you're about to watch, thanks youtube!ï»¿"
What is this song?ï»¿
The song is FMFDM- These boots are made for walking.ï»¿

"I'd say, give this movie a chance. The book was funny and witty. If they bring the right mix of depth from the books and downplay some of the more over-the-top bits (like the ninjas), it could potentially be a really amusing and fun movieï»¿"
"I thought the ""Pride, Prejudice, and Zombies"" series was interesting, but not enough to make a film.ï»¿"
"why, Tyrion Lannister, whyï»¿"
What the hell did I just see?ï»¿

"The sequel of Cinderella. A few years after Cinderella was married to the prince, a bunch of zombies invaded the kingdom and killed the prince, as well as the people. The fairy godmother turned her into a MMA fighter. Cinderella then called her friends and fought the zombies.ï»¿"

It's by FMFDM-these boots are made for walking.ï»¿
I believe it is a group called KM DFM?ï»¿
"Hot chicks and lots of action, just like suckerpunch, love itï»¿"
Tywin Lannister always badassï»¿
this might be a good cheesy movie to watch with friendsï»¿
"She is getting  boring. She plays in Cinderella, in tv series etc with the sames old dress set in old times.ï»¿"

The song in the background is: KMFDM - These Boots Are Made For Walkin'ï»¿
"Did they have kick-ass moves in the Regency period? I doubt it - and that, (bizarrely), is the reason why I wouldn't enjoy this, (as if a Regency period action flick having zombies in wasn't wierd/stupid enough).Also, why on EARTH did Charles Dance put his name to this tripe?

I feel like Jane Austin is turning in her grave.ï»¿
"+The Goombrat Especially since she even said she didn't like speculative fiction, so to change her book like this...still cool though :)ï»¿"

you're really not helping.ï»¿
+The Goombrat Yep and Nancy Sinatra should be suing the shit outta them.ï»¿
+The Goombrat Is saying to one who can't even write her name correctly...ï»¿
my mistake.ï»¿
_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ I was thinking the sameï»¿
"Actually, she might not mind this--somehow, the essence of the story manages to come through quite well. The interplay of characters, the foiled-then-saved romance...the whole comedy-of-manners still is present.Just with zombies. grinsï»¿"
I heard she wrote parodies so...ï»¿
Not really.ï»¿
"That's right sheep, give up your money to worship at the golden altar of Hollywood.  OBEY the Beast Box.  Just like those shirts you like wearing so much that say OBEY all over them.Here, have a movie about zombies and females, the progenitors of life.  Get in your cages you filthy animals and then you can be entertained.ï»¿"

Thanks I knew you guys would love it :)ï»¿
"Pride, Prejudice and Zombies*Seriously, English isn't even my native language and my grammar is better.ï»¿"
It's referring to the book pride and prejudice therefore it's essentially saying pride and prejudice as one thing rather than two and zombiesï»¿
+Shadownet Spy That title is not about grammar but about playing with the name of the original story. Language doesn't just consist of grammar but also of having fun with words.ï»¿
"+Shadownet Spy ""languish""ï»¿"
"@118boneÂ It was 01:00 am when I wrote that, I'm very tired. xDï»¿"
"+Shadownet Spy because English isn't your first language you missed the reference the title is making. The book is titled ""Pride and Prejudice.""ï»¿"
"+Shadownet Spy Its ""loosely"" based on the classic Pride and Prejudice. By ""loosely"" I mean it takes places in the same time era. Everything else is completely different.ï»¿"
"+Dongye Shen No, they use the same characters and the same love story but just add zombies into the mix.ï»¿"
+Shadownet Spy go away grammar naziï»¿

+Compton S  this movie is really cool!!!ï»¿
"I watched the first movie, now I'm reading the book, and in the future, I'll see this kick-ass movie!!!ï»¿"
"+Compton S It's okay, I wouldn't say it's the best zombie movie ever (Nor the most creative). The CGI effects, some of them at least, kind of suck. Overall though, I would see it a second time, which I may actually do, tomorrow night.ï»¿"
