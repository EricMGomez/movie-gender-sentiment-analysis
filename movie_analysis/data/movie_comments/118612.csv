What was the whatpad book called???ï»¿
Whatâ€™s the name of this book?ï»¿
looks goodï»¿
A movie with an unknown cast and premiering in April is NOT a good sign !ï»¿
"When this book was first on Wattpad, it had spelling and grammatical errors on almost every page ! It was obvious that it wasn't proofread. I forced myself to read the first book to see what all the fuss was about. When I started the second book, I realized it was more of the same ridiculous plot so I stopped reading it.  They broke up and got back together over and over again. After a while, this became very boring. The only explanation I have is that Tessa had very low self-esteem and Hardin was sociopathic. She could have gotten a much better boyfriend. The book was very illogical and unrealistic.  I hope that no one will believe they have to put up with such abusiveness in order to have a  relationship.  Such a waste of time !   _Ÿ‘_ï»¿"
What is this movie rated?!?!?!?!????!??ï»¿
"Now we need chasing red, storm and silence, the qb bad boy and me, roommates, a secret service, a kiss for clumsy, the Italian devil, etc etc. Wattpad books are fucking AMAZING and deserve to be made into movies. This is the the beginning of something big yâ€™all! Like if you agreeï»¿"

Such a tasteless book written with a mind of a twelve year old who thinks toxic and unhealthy relationships are sexy.ï»¿
I have a theory: this fantasy about an untamable brute whoâ€™s a dick to everyone but is inexplicably subdued by a timid (but self-respecting) bookworm is specific to girls who had a sexual awakening while watching Beauty and the Beast. _Ÿ_”ï»¿

TÃœRKLERR BURADA MI???ï»¿
"Can we take one second to say that Josephine is kind of skinny, like Tessa was supposed to be curvy and everything and I liked the fact that a teen romance character was not going to be skinny and it was supposed to send a great message to all the teens out there not corresponding to this stupid Hollywood criterion.

"Listen, I read this on Wattpad when it was literally a Harry Styles fanfiction. I don't get why people are acting like this isn't based on Harry Styles. They had to change the name because of legal reasons lol. Everyone who's saying 'this was inspired by' Harry... NO! It was LITERALLY a Harry Styles fanfic until it was published, PERIOD. It still is, just like 50 Shades is a Twilight fanfiction. As a matter of fact, this is a Harry Styles fanfiction inspired by 50 Shades of Grey. Let that sink in. Just think about it. Sheesh.ï»¿"
Now we wait for 'Wild' to become a movie.ï»¿

It happens in real life, people. Not every story should be all flowery and shit. If don't like the plot of the series, don't read it.

What type of teenagers 50 Shades of Gray bullshit is thisï»¿
If only boys were like this in high school ugh!ï»¿
"OKAY, letâ€™s not blame the book, the film AND claim that the people who are defending it are people whoâ€™s abusive and toxic. The book and film is not trying to promote ANY kind of abuse or toxic behavior AT ALL and this is coming from someone who had parents that were pretty rough with each other. But PEOPLE like you here that are quick to label this film as a promotion to send out the message that being in an abusive and toxic relationship is okay is exactly the REASON why it seems like the book and film itself is romanticizing and glorifying it when IT IS NOT. YOUâ€™RE CREATING A MISUNDERSTANDING TO THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER READ OR KNOWN ABOUT AFTER. Itâ€™s okay if you donâ€™t like the book and upcoming movie for it because everyone is entitled to what theyâ€™re into and what they arenâ€™t into BUT YOU CANNOT shove your opinion down someoneâ€™s throat and put what you think as a  LABEL and tape it on something. AND to those who are worried for Harryâ€™s reputation, YES the media will link this to him but the media itself KNOWS that this is a film inspired by HARRY from a fan. The book and film itself isnâ€™t supposed to portray who Harry is as a person, GET THAT. And everyone knows that Harry treats everyone with kindness and so should we but here you guys are, already labeling this film and book series as another fifty shades or a promotion to toxic relationship which is exactly what Harry will have to put up with if PEOPLE keep making these comments. But do know that you cannot tell everyone here that itâ€™s going to ruin Harryâ€™s reputation because the media will link it to him when YOU YOURSELF are doing the exact same thing by mentioning his name to this series when he was never associated to the book series other than an inspiration the author had used as a fan. HARRYâ€™S REPUTATION DOES NOT DEPEND ON A FICTIONAL CHARACTER. LASTLY, this is NOTHING like fifty shades of grey though the author had said it was inspired by it. Itâ€™s just like how she was inspired by Harryâ€™s looks. WATCH AND READ the series before labeling it a parody of teen fifty shades. LMAO, if you wanna say some, letâ€™s be civilized and not argue please because Iâ€™m tired of grown ass people trying to prove their point by arguing. Ok? Ok.ï»¿"

"So in the #me.too era, after everyone seems to be trying to progress the man/woman relationship dynamic to equality, Hollywood keeps churning out main stream movie series about stalkers and rapists. Edward was a stalker; 50 shades dude, stalker; this guy? Stalker. We as a society reap what we sow. There are other contributing factors, but we do mirror what we see supported in mass media. So stupid to take this format to a teen setting in High School. Like pedophiles need more mental ammo to go seduce their next 14 year old online. Good job Hollywood. Jack arses.ï»¿"

Anyone else here cause of Ariana Grande?_Ÿ”¥ï»¿
I'm better than you. Yasssï»¿
I lost count of how many times I've watch this trailerï»¿
OMFG FINALLYï»¿
Omg i remember reading this novel when i was fan of 1D! They should've let Harry Styles play the roleï»¿
So...I'm a bit confused ! What is the story about again????ï»¿
I really wish that it would be the same thing as in the book or else it's gonna be a disasterï»¿
Somethin' bout youuuï»¿
What is this? Like a teenage version of Fifty Shades of Grey?ï»¿
omg i remember reading this on wattpad!!! wowwwwwwwwwwwï»¿

0:36 i really thought that it was Kylie Jenner lolï»¿
"My opinion about all of the actorsWhen it was announced that Hero will play Hardin : idk, i have mixed feelings about thislater: OMG NOW I KNOW WHY ANNA CASTED HIM HES PERFECTO!watching the trailer(the history is repeating) i have mixed feelings about himI mean the dude said like one sentence but i didnt even get Hardin Scott vibe from it...He really does look like how i imagined Hardin but i imagined it also more rougher and more idk bad boy vibe with those percings and more tattoos, he seems more sweet and cute lmao which is not a bad thing but in the books he was represented as a rough, angry person and this guy in a movie seems like he is doing meditation every day and all about life being positive lmao but we will see i honestly really really like Hero and im sure he will be fine in this movie but welli feel like Jo will be the best one to potray her character..im really glad she is our Tessa instead of Julia..Julia looks older then Hero, the thought of them together makes me cringe and i just dont get the good vibe about her playing Tessa since the beginning. Jo will fucking slay this role. Also, Jo fits with Hero a lot better and they look cute asf im shipping it.I really love Innana and i also have mixed feelings about her playing my favorite female character. She is likeable, but i imagined Molly completely completely different. I dont know how she acts and idk i just feel 50/50 about her playing Molly. I wish Grace Van Dien was casted but whatevah.Swen is okay. I dont think he is that of a good actor, but at the same time, he isnt playing anyone big. I did imagined Jace like him but we will see.Shane playing Landon..50/50. He is very cute and i feel like he will be fine playing this character but idk..i just never seen him acting and i just hope he is a good actor in general.Khadijha..i imagined Steph exactly like this, but i never seen her act because she is a model, so im also not sure about her acting skills. If the girl knows how to act then she will also murder this role. I like her tho.Samuel Larsen..i didnt imagine Zed like this but he seems likeable and also - if he knows how to act then welcome to the team lol.Meadow ..I dont give a shit about her character honestly, but i feel like she will act good and i like her so yeah.Pia Mia..i liked Tristan and its interesting that Tristan is a girl now. I really like Pia and im sure she will be fine.Dylan..He's cute and i seen him act in some show..i feel like the guy knows how to act and will be amazing playing Noah so like for him.Selma Blair..love her as an actor and she will be amazing.Peter..FUCK YAS. He will be the best one to represent a parent of the main characters..he's just the best oml.Jennifer..didnt imagine her like that at all...Personally i imagined a cute little chubby woman and i dont really get the vibe of her playing sweet Karen but..idk we'll see.So..this is just my thoughts about the actors before we watch a trailer and a movie and to see how my opinion changed. Lmao. Thanks for reading tho.ï»¿"
omg i remember reading after in wattpad and now its gonna be a movieï»¿
I WANT TO WATCH THIS FILMï»¿

apple pie Iâ€™m 17 and just started reading it because itâ€™s so hyped up and it is SO toxic!! if my 13 year old self was reading it I wouldâ€™ve idolised it when in reality it is such an unhealthy relationship! Iâ€™m glad someone else agrees with meï»¿

"I donâ€™t think you guys are understanding what a fanfiction is so let me break it down for youFan fiction or fanfiction is fiction about characters or settings from an original work of fiction, created by fans of that work rather than by its creator.

Like how could you imagine watching your mum getting raped that would be so traumatising. I think its understandable for Hardin to act the way he does because he had a shit life growing upï»¿"

"The relationship is toxic. Period. If you say otherwise, you don't understand abuse and I think that FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY, you should do research on physical/verbal and mental abuse because abuse is not just physical and Tessa wanting to be in the relationship does not change the fact that the relationship is abusive. To anyone saying it 'can be toxic at times' or anything along those lines, congrats! You've minimized abuse! To anyone saying it shouldn't be compared to 50 shades, you should know the author is a fan of the series. To anyone saying this shouldn't be associated with Harry Styles, you're trying to downplay the roots of the story so you don't feel embarrassed about enjoying this and you should remember a a chunk of the fans like the idea of this being a movie because they loved One Direction or they want to see Wattpad thrive. The movie can be different than the book. I'm not trying to bash anyone involved in the making of the book or the film, but the movie industry is seriously latched onto this toxic trope and they will continue to milk it the more it's consumed. They made this because it will rake in cash. The cycle continues.ï»¿"

I get it how people are annoyed about some people saying it makes Harry look bad but think about a lot of us were like 9 when we loved One Direction so itâ€™s kinda weird and uncomfortable seeing one of our role models portrayed like this the movie looks okay but I just will not ever be able to look at Harry the same way ever again.ï»¿
"I read it in the past and I continue to read this story because I like it and it wonâ€™t never be enough. But, I have to say something to people who are here judging something that they donâ€™t even know. Itâ€™s not all about sex, you are the one who are assuming that. You have no idea about it. Your attitude towards a book that gains success is to throw shit on it. Thatâ€™s ridiculous. It was based on Harry Styles years ago and the author always underlined that there was nothing but the figure of Harry. However Iâ€™d like to say that Iâ€™ve already seen that some statements are different and the scenes in general as well. I know that a script cannot always be the perfect reflection of the book for so many reasons, but I find it strange and a little bit disappointing to see that things donâ€™t go like youâ€™d expect, because the magic isnâ€™t the same anymore, and you just feel different. Itâ€™s like you are watching something that you donâ€™t know about anymore. Obviously Iâ€™m talking as a fan of the trilogy. I hope that all other things and the plot in general would remain the same. The book is captivating not only for how it has been written but also because of the dynamic plot.ï»¿"

Listen I get you all having ur own opinion on the books and the movie or whatever and u are entitled to have ur own opinion and no one is going to force u to watch it or love it. But fr you all talking about how toxic the series is but look at you commenting and acting in such a toxic manor... Why spread negativity and hate. People worked hard for this. People love these books and this movie why can't u just sometimes keep ur opinion to urself and let people enjoy something they love and are passionate about. Gosh...ï»¿

I remember the times when this fanfic made me cry and laugh at the freaking same time. This movie is not just about sex and lust thingy for me it reflects a true story and reality of stubborn and immature couples yet who loves each other who's willing to be mature for the both of them.Ps. I know this fcking comment is too long, I didn't force anyone to read it thoï»¿"
Why is nobody talking about dangerous woman?!?! I LOVED THATï»¿
I miss his lip ring thing... I don't know what the name for this is in English_Ÿ˜‚ I guess lip piercing... Uehm.. Ok_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿

Bitch I just wanna say that the main character is hawt and that I need this movie now like he's too fine toï»¿
"OMG YES! Inanna Sarkis finally is apart of a movie!ï»¿"

Iâ€™m mad this is a movie now. The book was tiring and repetitive and all they did was have sex and sheâ€™d get emotionally abused by himï»¿
SO FREAKING EXCITED FOR THIS!!! It brings me back to younger me reading After for the first time omgggï»¿
Iâ€™m laughing too hardï»¿
Okay Tom Riddle....ï»¿

Birch I read this fanfic when it came outï»¿
I wish it was a series not a movie. It wouldâ€™ve been better in my opinionï»¿
Ezraa Hamdan I donâ€™t think so. Series can be extremely bad acting and can be canceled after the first episode.ï»¿
"Well youâ€™re right about the cancelling part cuz yeah I know some TV series that didnâ€™t make it after one season but I always feel like book series (that have more than 2 books) should become a series cuz they canâ€™t do all the 3 books and squish â€˜em in a 1, possibly 2 hour movie, cuz they delete A LOT of scenes and add scenes that arenâ€™t even mentioned in the book. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™d like to see it as a series because it would somewhat look like the book. Iâ€™m not trying to hate the movie, and Iâ€™m still gonna watch it but thatâ€™s just my opinion. Same with the maze runner itâ€™s a 5 part book series and they made it onto movies but they have nothing to do with the book which pisses me off. But itâ€™s okay I loved the books and I think thatâ€™s all that mattersï»¿"

"I'm going to make it as clear as possible: this movie ain't about Harry Styles. It's not made for One Direction fans either. This has nothing related to Harry Styles or One Direction in any way. Stop complaining about how Hero doesn't look like Harry. Anna was only inspired by Harry's looks when she wrote After, I repeat: INSPIRED; which means that Hero is not supposed to look (exactly) like Harry. Most of movies are inspired by something, but they are movies on their own. Moreover, this film is an adaptation, I repeat: ADAPTATION, which also means that some things can be changed (scenes or looks). If some One Direction fans came here just to see a movie with the actors looking like their faves: this isn't your place, you can go. Sorry if I sound rude but I hope you'll understand me anyway with my bad english!ï»¿"

He looks nothing like Harry Styles...ï»¿
aradhana parida Heâ€™s not supposed to. The Wattpad books were base off of Harry and that is why it was called a fanfic. The published and the movie  are not and that is why his name isnâ€™t Harry but is now Hardin.ï»¿

"When you put anything out into the world, it's subject for criticism. I don't think anyone should bash the author herself because it takes a lot to make it as far as she did, but the original idea of the story is toxic and I honestly hope they write it out of the movie because the film industry needs to stop milking this idea of romanticizing abuse.ï»¿"
@Maddie Summer yes baby_Ÿ™‚ï»¿
"@KierDaBear i understand that. If you read the book and watched the trailer you would see that some scenes were added and some were changed. Like the part where he caught her in his room. In the book he shouted at her but here he didn't...instead he kinda seduced her(I got no problem there_Ÿ˜…) and Anna did say herself that not everything would be in the movie...don't you think the movie industry knew about the toxicity as you all speak about before deciding to make it a movie? Obviously they would tone down on it since it will be watched by younger audience. I really don't get why people here are making such a big deal over a movie that is PURELY meant for entertainment. Everybody has different opinions yes, everyone can't like the same thing double yes, i mean I'm sure the notebook had haters or do still have haters but its that simple....if you don't like it don't watch it....as simply as that_Ÿ_·_Ÿè»The last statement wasn't for you no offence...i just don't like people hating on someone's sweat and blood that's all.ï»¿"

"I don't know where this is going but I don't want this movie to end up life fifty shades of grey..that was also suppose to show the viewers that the characters learn something from each other and heal there broken heartsAnd now from this I'm the book there is lots of fucked up scenes..the parts where Hardin kills her emotions all over again and other stuff too that make it more toxic than it already is..In the movie I bet they will remove most of the  important scene (as they can't put 100 chapters in 3 hour movie) and because of this I don't want this book to be another clichÃ©  or anythingWattpad version has lots of mistakes and things that doesn't make any sense (according to me)And the part that they always end up having sex annoys me to hellBit still o don't want that in the movie Because they just CAN'T END UP HAVING SEX AFTER EVERY GOOODAMN FIGHT YOU KNOWbut as people love this book so much this movie has this huge responsibility to maintain that image of the book ..In the end ..lolAm very excited for this movie And hoping that this will blow our minds just like the book did.. ..ï»¿"

I have a question is the actual book hard bookhard the same as the wattpad book? Like the writing and story and Harry's name is changed to Hardin in the hard bookï»¿
Joan Luzano I think there are some things that have been changed.ï»¿
OOOOOOOMMMMMGGGGGGGGGGGï»¿
I just canâ€™t wait for the scene where he canâ€™t sleep without Tessa because he gets nightmaresï»¿
Queen B yassssssï»¿
"HardinÂ´s nightmares are not going to appear in the 1 movie, Anna said this because they are going to be all time together so I guess he is fine with that xD But theyÂ´ll be in the 2 one girl!ï»¿"
I'm more interested in the seeing the scene where he goes to his father's house and starts breaking stuff and then lian calls her and she leaves that cardigan guy and stays the nightï»¿

"I donâ€™t understand why itâ€™s a problem to make a movie that portrays a toxic relationship? If every movie, book, etc. had perfectly saint characters then things would get 1)real boring real fast and 2)just not realistic at all. There are TONS of genres and TONS of different relationships. As long as itâ€™s obvious that the relationship is toxic and is NOT romanticized and is given a proper rating to make sure itâ€™s only seen by a certain age group then I donâ€™t see what the problem is. Imagine someone making a movie about Hitler or some serial killer or other messed up things that happen IN REAL LIFE and have people be upset about it. Why? There are people analyzing movies and books everyday. They know the relationships being portrayed and theyâ€™re actively discussing them. This is just a normal part of life. Nothing is sunshine and rainbows all the time. If this movie is romanticizing the relationship then okay, thatâ€™s wrong. But if itâ€™s NOT romanticizing it and is just portraying it as the toxic one that it is then I donâ€™t see any problem. Thatâ€™s just my opinion. Feel free to tell me what you think!ï»¿"
"https://youtu.be/jSuDfxA9BIg reaction video and minor commentary, in case anyone cares. I feel like there are so many bad comments toward the book. I feel like I need to do another video talking about itï»¿"

and the piercings of Hardin?!?!ï»¿
"We explain and explain and explain, just yet people donâ€™t get it. IT IS NOT ABOUT HARRY STYLES stop comparing Hardin to Harry. In the Wattpad version, Anna just wanted you to imagine Hardin AS Harry (the looks), nothing else, so please, just stop. This now has nothing to do with Harry Styles.  If you read all 4 books youâ€™ll know the real story. Stop saying itâ€™s an â€œabusive relationshipâ€ù till you read the whole thing.  Backstory about Hardin Scott: he came from a really dark childhood where his father was an alcoholic, then left him, and his mom got raped. He felt guilty and broken. HE WAS BROKEN UNTIL TESSA CAME INTO HIS LIFE. But as the story goes, heâ€™ll get better and happier. He changes, just like other people change.ï»¿"

"All these comments say the same thing â€œtoxic, Harry styles, fanfic, toxicâ€ù shut the fuck up already. If you havenâ€™t read the books, you canâ€™t give an opinion about it. Stop trying to just go along with what everyone else is saying for likes. Only people whoâ€™ve read the entire series have a say on what kind of book and movie After is. Trust me, their relationship is toxic at first, but throughout the books, they change. Yâ€™all are a bunch of pussies who canâ€™t bare to see the reality of most relationships out there that start off toxic and sometimes remain that way but often times people are capable of changing. But keep hating on After for clout ig, youâ€™re just doing free  promo for us xï»¿"
"If you canâ€™t already tell, this is based off of a Wattpad story.I love Harry, but that fanfic was not great.ï»¿"

"(COMENTARIO DE SARA EN ESPAÃ‘OL)Necesito decir algunas cosas;1. Harry Styles ya no estÃ¡ relacionado con esta pelÃ_cula, una vez estuvo hace muchos aÃ±os, se acabÃ_ ahora.2. SÃ_, esta relaciÃ_n es tÃ_xica, pero recuerda que son adolescentes y aÃºn no han madurado, pero saben que lo harÃ¡n pronto.3. Hero y Harry no deben ser comparados. Hero se basa en la versiÃ_n publicada del libro y Harry era solo un fan fiction.4. SÃ_, esta pelÃ_cula tendrÃ¡ muchas escenas explÃ_citas, pero recuerda que son adolescentes y que pronto madurarÃ¡n.5. Esta relaciÃ_n comienza muy tÃ_xica, pero debes saber que no siempre es lo mismo.6. Harry Styles no tiene NADA que ver con esta pelÃ_cula. (SÃ_, lo he dicho otra vez)7. En los libros, esta relaciÃ_n era mÃ¡s tÃ_xica, pero debido al pÃºblico, cambiaron MUCHAS cosas en esta pelÃ_cula para que sea mÃ¡s apropiada para la audiencia.8. No todos disfrutarÃ¡n o entenderÃ¡n esta pelÃ_cula, no es su clichÃ© tÃ_pico.9. Si realmente habÃ_a una razÃ_n para odiar en esta pelÃ_cula basada en Harry Styles, no hay razÃ_n. Recuerde que este libro fue escrito por una niÃ±a hace muchos aÃ±os que apenas era conocido por CUALQUIERA y comenzÃ_ a escribir fan fiction (como muchos libros de Wattpad en estos dÃ_as). MÃ¡s tarde, cuando el libro recibiÃ_ mÃ¡s atenciÃ_n y se hizo famoso, era bastante obvio que no podÃ_a mantener el nombre de Harry si lo iba a publicar, por lo que se cambiÃ_ a Hardin. Ahora, cuando se estrena la pelÃ_cula, se asegurÃ_ de deshacerse de cualquier cosa que no le gustara al pÃºblico, diferente de leer un libro.10. Sepa que esta pelÃ_cula es ahora propia, y no tiene mÃ¡s vÃ_nculos con nadie / nada.EdiciÃ_n: muchos de tus comentarios hablan sobre cÃ_mo esta pelÃ_cula es tan tÃ_xica y he tratado de minimizar la mierda. Bueno, dÃ©jame explicarte y habrÃ¡ spoilers, asÃ_ que ten cuidado.Â Hardin tuvo una infancia muy jodida, sin figura paterna y su madre tambiÃ©n fue violada y Ã©l estuvo allÃ_ para presenciar toda la escena. CreciÃ_ con la mente jodida y tenÃ_a pesadillas todas las noches. No estaba mentalmente bien y necesitaba ayuda, pero siempre se mantuvo alejado de la terapia porque no querÃ_a cambiar, no querÃ_a ser una mejor persona porque sabÃ_a que estaba jodido y que nadie podÃ_a arreglarlo. Cuando Tessa entra en su vida, todavÃ_a es tÃ_xico porque sabe que esta pelÃ_cula se basa en una apuesta y no le importaron los sentimientos en ese momento porque no le importaba a quiÃ©n lastimÃ_. Cuando arruina la mente de Tessa, se da cuenta de lo que ha estado haciendo porque realmente la amaba. A lo largo del libro, Ã©l tratÃ_ de cambiar para ella y para todos los demÃ¡s muchas veces. Y tuvo Ã©xito muchas veces tambiÃ©n. En el segundo libro, madurÃ_ mucho y tambiÃ©n Tessa y Hardin no fueron tan abusivos como Ã©l. Sepa que hay 5 libros, cada libro tiene su propia historia y cambia. Hardin madurÃ_ MUCHO el tiempo y recibiÃ_ terapia porque Tessa le habÃ_a hecho cambiar su opiniÃ_n sobre la vida. Hardin odiaba a los niÃ±os desde el fondo de su corazÃ_n, pero Tessa cambiÃ_ eso y al final (epÃ_logo) tuvieron hijos propios. A Hardin no le gustaban muchas cosas, pero Tessa siempre lo cambiaba para Ã©l y, cuando no estaba en una relaciÃ_n con Tessa (interrumpida), hacÃ_a una mierda jodida porque la extraÃ±a y sabe que lo que hizo estuvo mal. Hardin estaba jodido, Tessa entrÃ_ en su vida, se arruinaron la una a la otra, pero pronto, crecieron y maduraron juntos y esta relaciÃ_n NO va a seguir siendo la forma en que se ve. Si no ha leÃ_do la versiÃ_n publicada de los libros, entonces no haga predicciones y hable sobre algo que no conoce completamente. La versiÃ_n de Wattpad fue escrita por una mujer joven cuando ni siquiera era famosa (sÃ© que mucha gente lo hace ahora) y Harry Styles estÃ¡ completamente fuera de escena, pero Anna todavÃ_a tiene los libros en Wattpad, asÃ_ que sus compaÃ±eros fanÃ¡ticos no pueden puede pagar la versiÃ_n publicada del libro y, o no tener acceso a Ã©l, aÃºn puede leer la versiÃ_n anterior de After si lo desean.Debo haberte consentido mucho, pero debes saber que este libro se basa en algo realista, no es un primer amor de secundaria y un problema te rompe y pronto vuelven a estar juntos y se casan. No entiendo por quÃ© a la gente le gusta ver cosas exageradas no originales una y otra vez y no querrÃ_a ver algo realista. Al igual que 13rw hablÃ_ sobre Bullying, Suicidio y Asalto Sexual y a muchas personas no les gustÃ_ ver cosas de las que nadie habla. Insaciable, algo que a muchas personas no les gustaba ver cosas de las que normalmente no se habla.PerdÃ_n por la perorata, sepa que estoy defendiendo las razones correctas y que sus opiniones son suyas, pero tenga en cuenta que a veces sus opiniones lastiman a las personas, es mejor quedarse callado de esa manera.EdiciÃ_n 2: si tienes que odiar algo, empÃºjalo en el culo porque a nadie le importa una mierdaï»¿"

"yall do realise that teenagers and people in general having toxic relationships are in no means justification for writing feature films about such a thing and framing them in any other way than awful and repulsive.... you know that, right? cause if you ARE conscious that it IS a toxic relationship and that toxic relationships are bad and hurt people permanently, you wouldnt support a film that frames such relationships as hot, or cute, or as anything resembling something you should want or desire to have. which is what this film is doing. if the whole point of having a toxic relationship is to show that its bad and that people need to change in order for their shit to work out, then you should frame it as such. because film has the power of depicting certain topics and choosing the way people relate to them by framing, cause guess what, the way you frame shit does influence the way people look at it. remember american history x. c'mon, you guys.ï»¿"

"Someone said that finally.Making a toxic relationship looks like it is amazing it's a big no for me, especially in this period when women need to know they have to break up with guys who don't treat them good before it's too late.The story makes it looks like it will end good even if you don't leave him but it won't, most of the times it will end with the death of someone or someone really hurt and that someone it's not the bad one.ï»¿"

"Shup up nobody is saying that they want a boyfriend like hardin and there's a huge difference between talking about a toxic relationship and romanticize it, and yes this is about a toxic relationship ship nobody is saying the opposite, but if you read the 4 books you'll see that they realize how toxic they are and then broke and they spent years apart to grow and heal, so when they got back together thay can have a healthy relationshipï»¿"
@Elizabeth Hidalgo this still isn't good. It teach girls who are in a toxic relationship that it will somehow become real love and we all know in real life this doesn't happen. Most of the time the girl end up dead if she doesn't break up and understand he won't change that easy.ï»¿
"@Kilari 20 I hate when people say ""it teaches girls..."", girls aren't fucking retards. I hear this all the time and I'm sick of it.ï»¿"
"@ss ll I said it teaches girls because, also for personal experience, girls who read take books as a guide to go through life. Of course it isn't the same for every girls but for some of them it still is.ï»¿"
"@Kilari 20 yeah i get and understand your point, but the point of the book is show you what is like to be in a toxic relationship and what happen when you don't get out of it, but remember that this is THESE CHARACTER'S STORY and that's why the author wanted them to end up together, but once again i get your point and i think that you have to be mature and smart enought to realize that is not healthy and it's not good to stay in relationships like these and not everybody have the same luck as these charactersï»¿"

Everyone comparing it to 50 shades of grey just cause it has sex ok I didn't know 50 shades of grey invented sex in a movieï»¿
It's also as toxic as the 50 shades seriesï»¿
@potato 1D and I guess people loved it considering it got 3 movies which means after could too so we stay winningï»¿
"@Sammm lmao, I just said that the relationship is really toxic. Idc if you guys are winning or anything. Anyways, the next two movies can be cancel if it's not a hit so_Ÿ’Åï»¿"
@potato 1D I know but considering 50 shades of grey has a toxic relationship and still was a hit I don't see how after can'tï»¿
"No, people are comparing it because itâ€™s a toxic relationship that happens to start off as a fan fiction and then got made into books. Now itâ€™s a movie.ï»¿"
@Stalking* Funtime nah most of the people that are saying it's toxic don't even mention 50 shades of grey everyone knows when 50 shades of grey is mention is all about fucking. Also most people don't even know that it was a fanfic of twilight I barely found out like 2 days ago I must say I was quite shockedï»¿
They compare it because the stories were both twilight fanfictionsï»¿
This fan fiction was literally inspired by 50sog but go offï»¿
"Male main abused as a child, engages in toxic relationships, closed off and doesnâ€™t want help until the â€œoneâ€ù comes along, guy magically fixes himself and resolves past trauma for the girl. Girl is pretty and a virgin. Not to mention the style of the sex scenes in the trailer... but yeah, I wonder why people compare _Ÿ˜‚ï»¿"
"no but it DID popularise toxic and abusive relationships so i mean, i guessï»¿"
Mysterious guy + plus simple girl getting complicated after the sexual chemistry + sexy theme song...yes 50 shades.ï»¿
Vanessa Win Both? This one is a One Direction Fanfiction.ï»¿
Omg thank youï»¿
@Sammm YES THANK YOUï»¿
"Sam Twilight got 5 movies, doesnâ€™t mean any were actually good.ï»¿"
@DuckyDae X that's true but for people who liked twilight that's must've been amazing for themï»¿
"Sam Sure, itâ€™s amazing watching an abusive relationship be normalised and further portraying teen girls as the lowest common dominator.ï»¿"
@DuckyDae X yes because girls who are in a toxic relationship is because of twilight lolï»¿
No but 50 shades started what's know as 'new adult' and After is in this categoryï»¿
"Oh come on it is comparable to 50 shades of grey but this is like tween/teen version. Both uses seductive music in the trailers indicating the next point, both revolves around sexual themes, both male lead are fucked up dominating sex addict, both female lead are â€œangelsâ€ù opposites to the male lead. And itâ€™s fine. It is what it is.ï»¿"
"Right... I keep seeing people say ohhh ""it's like fifty shades buy for teenagers"" I'm just like shut the f*** up it for people that like the seriesï»¿"
It just has one scene that's identical _Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
It's actually like 50 shades though bc 50 shades was originally twilight fan fiction and this movie is based off a book that's harry styles fan fictionï»¿
Lmao people compare it because both are fanfiction...ï»¿
@HorseGrape read the book then talk.. its not fix himself and resolve past trauma for the girlï»¿
"dingo baby Lmao chill. I was just going off what someone in another comment said about the final books. I only read the first two. Iâ€™m not hating on the book at all, just saying why I think people are comparing.ï»¿"
Sammm its obvi piggy backing on itï»¿
"Lmao funny enough I actually just watched all 50 shades of grey with my girlfriend (we all know how that went where's my high fives) and it never really stuck out that 50 shades is a ""toxic"" relationship. I just felt like he was protective, doesn't really matter if this movie is similar to 50 shades there's significant differences that will clearly change the plot. For example he's not a millionaire and they aren't adults, which makes this a much more interesting story because a lot of people get to see it happen. For example me personally I fit that stereotype of abused boy who finds virgin girl and kinks her out and then things get complicated. So this movie should be interestingï»¿"
potato 1D those two books arr nothing alike !!ï»¿
ISTG illiterate fucksï»¿
Ness Ahhh__ not at all. Fifty shades was beyonce crazy in love and Afterâ€™s song is Ariana grande Dangerous womanï»¿
"Don Gambino i haven't seen the movie, so i dont know if the abuse is toned down or if you're just not receptive to it's subtleties. Perhaps given that you identify with the character, those forms of abuse may be normal to you. There's plenty of commentaries detailing the possessive nature of Christian and why it's wrong if you'd like to better understand it. I hope your girlfriend is okay. The fact that this story happens between two teenagers makes it far more disturbing. Young adults have brains very much like a teenager. A teen is certainly more impressional and less autonomous in those circumstances. The worst thing is that this movie has a teenage audience. Teens do not need to watch or read about gratuitous sex.ï»¿"

"It's so simple, don't watch the movie if it's not what you align with. I read the book, enjoyed it for the most part, although I do admit it's repetitive and the relationship can be toxic, I am hoping production tweaked the film a bit, but I am still excited to watch it and I am not going to condone what the film portrays in real life. This is a movie, it's not real. If you guys are complaining about it and how it's going to trigger abused people, it's more about don't watch this movie and help them a different way. It is just a film.ï»¿"

"Yes it's a film. But media has influence on people. I've had enough of people defending toxic relationships in books/movies and saying ""it's just a book/movie, it's not real"". No, it's not a real story. That doesn't mean that it's okay. Toxic relationships that go unchallenged in stories normalise those relationships and show young, susceptible kids that unhealthy relationships like this are okay. Which they aren't.ï»¿"
@Sylvie Jones I agreeï»¿
"â€‹@Sylvie Jones and honestly, that part is up to the guardians of these kids to teach them to not be so easily swayed by what they see on television. i am not going to go look for a toxic relationship after this move nor did I do that after reading the book a few years ago. Everything has influence on people, EVERYTHING. and by how fast things are moving with the media today, a lot of it has to do with understanding what they should or shouldn't let go of when they watch, read or hear something because more and more things will come out that will be labeled problematic.ï»¿"
"first: Tessa and Hardin definitely donâ€™t have a healthy relationship. Does it mean that the abuse in it is romanticized? No. If there was no problem for the couple in this book, it would be boring. What did you guys want? Boy meets girl, falls in love and they get married? Please. Hardins major problem is his possessiveness and selfishness, but Tessa doesnâ€™t like him for that, sheâ€™s not like â€œaw I love it when you call me a whoreâ€ù â€” btw, THAT would be romanticize abuse â€” she stands up for herself and leaves him every time, and he always recognizes his mistakes and apologizes and actually tries to be better for her. Also, if you had any abusive relationships, youâ€™d know that itâ€™s nothing like that. The abusive partner makes you think that youâ€™re worthless and thatâ€™s why you canâ€™t break up with them: you think theyâ€™re the only one that will want you. Hardin does the complete opposite, heâ€™s always complimenting Tessa and acting like sheâ€™s his world, he always says sheâ€™s too good for him and for anyone. He hates himself, but he loves her and if you couldnâ€™t tell it reading the book, then you obviously read it wrong. Iâ€™m not arguing that their relationship is toxic though, but itâ€™s not like 50 shades where it IS romanticized. Tessa doesnâ€™t accept his behavior and for that reason, they break up thousands of times and only when they both matured, they stay together.ï»¿"

So the relationship was obviously very toxic at tge beginning and yes a lot of things that happened were bad but if you follow the whole series then you would know at the end that they actually leave each other for two years and honestly Hardin was working on getting himself better before rhen and after the two years when they come back together they arw both on much better placea.  Are toxic relationships always like that in real life....no.... But sometimes people do change plus this is a movie. I just think if you think the movie is bad and the book is bad and the story is bad don't comment on the trailer or anything. _Ÿ_·ï»¿
*both in better placesï»¿
Can I ask how it's toxic? I didn't finish the book _Ÿ˜…ï»¿

@Kylie i don't  want to spoil it for you but it is a very good book series! It's very honest and doesn't shy away from anything. Hardin had a ruff childhood which made him the way he is sort of. Tessa and Hardin bring out the best and worst in each other. It's a great story!  Definitely finish the series!ï»¿
@Brittany McDowrll Please spoilllll. It's alright! Please tell me more about what do they do to each other that makes them toxic. I'm so excited sjjsjskakakaï»¿

The thing here it's that the plot gives girls in toxic relationships the hope it will work out and we all know what happens in real life in this occasionsï»¿
@Kilari 20 I see what your saying but also why should we give girls the idea that it doesn't ever work out? Yes sometimes and most of the time it doesn't but it does sometimes and I think now a days we need happy endings. Regardless their are movies and shows that give girls and guys ideas thay aren't right..  There will always be a little negativity with everything!ï»¿
"@Brittany McDowrll I see your point but I still think if a boy (or a girl) treat you the way Hardin treated Tessa you should break up, close the chapter and never read it again because it doesn't worth the risk.I think we can say we agree to disagree.ï»¿"
"@Kilari 20 yes, the movie is for some people and not for others. Some people can watch it and not get unrealistic expectations and others can not.  I just think people who don't want to watch it should just keep their negative comments to themselves(not you because you were very kind in the way you expressed your opinion)ï»¿"

"Well... I wasnâ€™t passionated about the first book... But the second was too much... I couldnâ€™t even finish it. The main character, Tessa, is freaking stupid, she doesnâ€™t have personality, and she can be influenced even by a fly. Hardin is the typical bad boy blablabla blablabla. And their relationship is TOO MUCH STRESSFUL, first of all they love each other like if they had to die the next day, after 5 minutes they hate each other, then they have sex to solve it, and back to start, over and over again, thatâ€™s what the second book is about (at least the first half, cause as I said before, I didnâ€™t finish it_Ÿ˜‘). Maybe in the second half everything changes and happens something magic that turns this story less awful...

"I have to say something. See, this is a one minute teaser, not the full trailer. What you see here, is in no way anything you can expect from this movie. And the funny thing is, people are gonna see this movie anyway, just so they can say shit about it - well, I don't give a fuck, when you go and see this movie, we will get the second one, so you'll just make us happy. I hate to see how people think Fifty Shades of Grey is ''good'' and ''different'', yet, how toxic was that ? This book is so different from anything I've ever read. And you know why? Because I read all the books, because I didn't just read the first one. Because I didn't listen to what people told me about this book, I just went and read it to see for myself. The first book is just the start of something huge, a very emotional yet romantic rollercoaster. Yes, the first book has toxic elements. But that's exactly what Anna Todd (the writer) wanted to show. Some people are toxic. Some relationships start off toxic. There are people with shitty childhoods and trauma's, it fucks up who they are. There are people who can't love anyone. And Anna Todd wanted to show people what effect people can have on people. Tessa changed Hardin, in ways he never thought possible. And you guys have no clue how, because none of these haters have read every single word of the five books out there. You're basing your opinion on opinions you've heard on social media, on reading a few chapters, on reading the first book but nothing more, on the fact that this is ''based off a boyband and it's a fanfiction''. Who the fuck cares??? Aside from the fact that the only thing about One Direction she ever used were their names and their looks, I have a surprise for you, Fifty Shades was based off of Twilight: A FANFICTION. To All The Boys I've Loved Before, The Kissing Booth, Fifty Shades - they're all fanfiction turned into movies. The difference? This writer chose to discuss something that's different from other fanfiction for teenagers. She chose to discuss REAL PROBLEMS THAT SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY GO THROUGH. Do I like Tessa and Hardin's relationship in the first book? God, no. I hate how Hardin drives her mad. I hate the influence he's got on her. I hate his intentions. BUT THAT'S THE POINT. Hate him! He's fucked up. You're hating him as much as Tessa does at first, as much as Noah does, as much as Tessa's mom does. You're hating Hardin as much as he hates himself. But that changes. The story changes. The intentions change. Hardin changes. Tessa changes. In the other books, it's not even about their mental influence on each other anymore. It's about who they are - and about who Tessa and Hardin help each other to become. But y'all haters didn't know this, did you? No, cause you've never even cared to read the whole story to understand anything about this. If you hate it so much and refuse to understand the story, then LEAVE. Don't watch this movie, don't watch this teaser, don't talk to the fandom. Don't bother, go somewhere else. If it's so bad, do all of us a favor and just leave. This movie is becoming a thing anyway and you can't do anything about it. Go give hate to something that actually deserves hate. Good day, everyone.ï»¿"
"Thank you! All these comments from people, who probably just heard about this book make me sick!!! I hate Hardin for everything he's done to Tessa, because I know how it feels, when you're in a relationship with a fucked up person. But Anna made one good point: she showed us, that some fucked up people can change. And in After forever they broke up for over a year, so they can focus on themselves before getting back to the roots. Anna showed us, that we don't have to be with someone forever, when he treat you like shit. But if he changes for you, makes a therapie and faught to get you back, it's real love, a lot of people don't know about. So shut the fuck up people, and read the books.ï»¿"

"Im so tired of this bitches in the comments putting down the movie. First of all, this is the drama that is supposed to have some kind of a story ..yall want what? Rainbows, flowers, love, love, love..This is called DRAMA for a reason. The story just makes you feel some type of way if u actually understand it. The relathionship was toxic, untill they decided to break up in the end and when he became a succesful author, they ended up together healthier and happier then ever. They went through a lot of shit just so they can become that. Also, i dont understand what's wrong with toxic relathionships in the movies? If people can show rape, anorexia, bullying and all of the realistic shit,  toxic relathionships are everywhere and it taught the main characters how to be better people. Life isnt perfect, relathionships are not either and honestly, the books are pretty relatable..Hardin hating himself, traumatic childhood, Tessa being insecure about herself and also scared to make a mistake because her mom is always pressuring her to be perfect, learning about love and that not everyone's life is perfect..Not to judge someone like everyone did with Molly, but also not to trust everyone like Steph..learning about fake friends(Steph) and great ones (Landon), learning about sex, yourself and so much more. And please stop talking about Harry..Anna was IMAGINING him to look like that and talk like dat, she never put his name down or made him as a human being - bad. Just like she did with Indiana Evans. The book is absolutely beautiful and the character development of Hardin and Tessa is really fucking powerful. If u dont like it, fine then go and let us, the real og fans enjoy this moment. The team also put so much effort in this movie like be more respectful. I've waited so long for this moment and it piss me of when i see comments like ""wow the toxic relathionship is turning into a movie!1"" if u wanna watch the real romantic movie without drama, there are plenty of that shit on internet. I've never seen a story like dis and it's gonna be so epic and interesting. Ur shitty comments can go fuck themselves. Now let my parents -  Jo and Hero slay 2019 in peace_Ÿ’Å_Ÿ’… So much love to Anna and the whole team for creating this for us. God bless all of them.ï»¿"
"I met my now husband when I was 19 and he was 22. Our relationship turned into basically a unhealthy obsession with eachother, it was like an addiction and he wasn't the best person back then. I for sure wasn't perfect either.  After over two years I finally walked away even though I was still very much in love with him. It was one of the hardest things i've ever done, but I had to do it for my own sanity. About three years passed and even though we'd go months and months without any communication (though we always knew what the other was up to), almost a year at times their was always that love there. No other person compared. But we needed that time to mature and have different experiences. Finally we confronted each other and had the most honest, hardest talk about our past and how toxic we had been and how we either needed to truly let eachother go or use what we'd learned over the past few years and work on building a solid foundation to be in a healthy relationship. And we've now been married almost 7 years and it blows my mind sometimes at the effort my husband has put into becoming the man I deserve. I haven't read this book but what you said was spot on and love and relationships are messy and hard as hell but totally worth it if it's the right person.  I think I might check out the books because this looked interesting. Just thought I'd share that some people can truly change.ï»¿"
"@Stephie C wow that's so beautiful and inspiring. Just wow. The similiar situation happened in the books - i'm not gonna spoil important details but they did had a huge break that lasted 2 or 3 years where they went separate ways to find themselves and got back together stronger than ever and lived their happily ever after.

"@tÃ¢nia dias No one is teaching girls to have a toxic relathionship especially not fictionary movies lmao. Parents are the only people who can affect ur relathionship with ur future partner, how u were raised, same goes with ur taste and who u pretty much, fall in love.  Hardin is a complicated character, he can be toxic but he was crazy about Tessa and he truly loved her - and that's the only reason why girls are fantasizing their relathionship. Did you see the first person who replied? They still made their way back to each other no matter how toxic their relathionship was at the beginning. No one wants a real - life toxic relathionship, if girls are fantasizing about Hardin, it's only because he showed those good sides to Tessa like love, loyalty and fighting for her, which is rare that someone loves you that deeply in 21st century lol...The plot is the interesting teen drama i mean that exists for a reason and it's different. Where did u see a story like this? Hm? I put so many reasons why this is such a good book yet you are coming at me that they had their bad moments in a relathionship and that people are fantasizing it. My parents had a very toxic relathionship when they were young and they have the best marriage ever. If the only problem for u makes that for watching a movie while they are also so many reasons why it's awesome - then go watch something u prefer and idk - if u didnt understood my two whole ass paragraph, well i tried.ï»¿"
Who read the entire coment?ï»¿
"@Laura Bee if u did, thank u my friend xxï»¿"
"@Maria Tina movies can have a big affect on people, especially young girls or boys, sure this movie could go in a complete opposite direction and show why this is not a good relationship or it could go the way the book went, which was toxic, hardin would manipulate her, even if he did love her, that relationship is still toxic and the movie will hopefully show that even if someone loves you, if they are also toxic, it isnt worth it in the end, i hope it does so young girls and boys do not think this toxic relationship is alrightï»¿"
"@Holly Kelly  The only reason why their relathionship worked is because they loved each other. So if a kid sees some fucked up shit on TV where a guy is fucking a cactus, means  when they grow up, the kid is gonna try doing it? If a girl sees idk a lesbian couple in a movie means she will be a lesbian when she grows up? God! Stop finding a reason to hate this movie! Jesus Christ. He was doing his best to be the best for her, and he didnt even laid a hand on her..He cared for her when she was drunk, when she was broken in the 3rd book and dude like there is so many beautiful things about their relathionship. There are 300 long chapters of this book and you have the time to repeat the same shit about their relathionship all over again. Im gonna say it again - the book showed what kind of problems the whole characters are going through. Family issues, issues with yourself, friends even and it's very relatable in many aspects. Just because their relathionship is complicated,  doesn't mean it's shit. Anna showed amazing parts of their relathionship and emotions for each other, but also the ugly ones which is always a part that comes with it. The book is fucking awesome, the movie will be too and yall little hoes that are finding a reason to hate it can screw themselves.ï»¿"
THANK YOUï»¿
"Yes girl say it louder for the people in the back, like if you actually understood the book, it is doing the opposite of romanizing toxic relationship, like they eventually know they cannot work out and take time to grow into their own person and it's just people have to read ALL books to understand but someone's always gonna say something right _Ÿ_·_Ÿè»â€çâ™€ï¸è_Ÿ_·_Ÿè»â€çâ™€ï¸èï»¿"
"tÃ¢nia dias sorry that you ""grew up"" but this is all soo false like read all of them and understand them, you can seriously be saying that the toxic relationship is all the book is about m, yes it's toxic but that's the problem that's the whole plot and If you were to read all book they both grow through out the relationship and even take years always from eachother to become better it's about self growth and acceptance asshole damn I'm 18 and if this is ""growing up"" than no thank you sir sorry you are so bitter I wish rainbows and fairies for you _Ÿ˜˜_Ÿ˜˜_Ÿ˜†sending love and kindness your wayï»¿"

Tijana Diva TRUTHï»¿
"@Genesis Lara YAS SISTER! FINALLY SOMEONE WHO GETS IT_Ÿ™Œ_Ÿ‘è_Ÿ‘__Ÿ’ª Also both of them are like 19/20 years old, what kind of relathionship is perfect at that age? Book has so many beautiful moments and plots, also the ugly ones which makes the book realistic asf and yet this people that wanna find a reason to hate the movie and the book, always say the same shit about their relathionship and that's its toxic. Yes brother, we all know it's toxic but did they tried to make the relathionship work no matter how complicated it was and because they really loved each other? Yes they did and they were slowly moving into better and better place and that's why it worked. If there is lack of love and you are just stuck and stuck in a relathionship and you feel like you aren't moving anywhere better - that's where lies the real problem at real - life toxic relathioships that wont get you nowhere. They went their seperate ways just so they could get to know themselves better before stepping into marriage and their marriage was far from toxic. And no one teaches ""girls"" to stay in a toxic relathionship, they have parents for that to teach them what kind of life partner they should have and there are a lot of teens that can learn a lot from other characters storylines and thoughs, also relate to someone like i did with Hardin personally.. Its really interesting how many people agree with the people that dont like the book or the movie and yet here they are, helping us get those views and making it even more popular. It was already big but thanks to yall it's getting even more bigger lmao the power of hatersï»¿"

I was so frustrated with the Wattpad book because it was really toxic and sent a bad message to the reader. Romanticizes toxic relationships and the couple are so young. The fact that it's so popular and many people actually love it says a lot about this generation. I hope the movie is a little different. Haven't read the published version yet but I hope it's different than the original wattpad storyï»¿
"TheAwkwardDiva I would recommend the published version. Itâ€™s so much better but itâ€™s still toxic tbh. The writing is better and thereâ€™s slight changes, but it seems like they are going to tone down the toxicity in the relationship for the movieï»¿"
Teenage fifty shades of grey with anger issues instead of a fascination with bdsm _Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
This After Movie is FICTIONAL. Itâ€™s the fantasies of the writer and doesnâ€™t represent harry or who he really is as a person. Itâ€™s her own toxic 1D fan fic . Just leaving this out here because some people seem to get it mixed up . Fictional. It doesnâ€™t represent Harryâ€™s own romantic relationships with the women he dated in his real life or how he treat women. Itâ€™s the writer fantasy and projections. Itâ€™s not about him and he have nothing to do with it whatsoever.ï»¿

Ahhhhhhhh... IM SOO EXCITEDï»¿
"I read this book last year and it was one of the most toxic relationships Iâ€™ve ever read about. It was just a dumb cycle of Hardin being cruel to her, then he starts being nice to her, them having a cute moment, having sex, and then having a huge fight (for literally NO reason). Oh yeah, and donâ€™t forget Tessa cheating on her boyfriend for months instead of just breaking up with him. Repeat this cycle about every 5 chapters and thatâ€™s the entire book for you. I just canâ€™t believe that theyâ€™re actually making a movie of this and people are actually excited??ï»¿"
"Shup up nobody is saying that they want a boyfriend like hardin and yes this is about a toxic relationship ship nobody is saying the opposite, but if you read the 4 books you'll see that they realize how toxic they are and then broke and they spent years apart to grow and heal, so when they got back together thay can have a healthy relationshipï»¿"
"Elizabeth Hidalgo That doesnâ€™t excuse the fact that millions of teenage girls idealize their toxic relationship in the first book/movie and forgive him for severely verbally abusing Tessa because heâ€™s a â€œdamaged bad boy.â€ù If they grew and healed by the last book, good for them. That still doesnâ€™t make their relationship heathy.ï»¿"
"@hazry once again their relationship is for a FACT NOT HEALTHY AT ALL, and if young girls misunderstand that is under their responsibility, the author never romanticize their relationship, i just think that you have to be mature enough to watch and read it and understand that their behaviors are not okay, and still enjoy itï»¿"

"Breiana Yes I am serious, and I speak when I have read the wattpad version and the published version. Just because she changed the name to â€œHardinâ€ù and edited a few things here and there does not change how awful this book is for promoting â€œhe yells and verbally abuses you because he loves youâ€ù. No matter what, I personally think that this is a disaster and is only going to fuel the ideology inside peopleâ€™s heads about the perfect relationship with a â€œbadboyâ€ù and how it should be toxic. Now before Iâ€™m attacked, this is just my opinion which Iâ€™d say 50% of people would agree with: After is garbage. Worse than garbage for portraying teens in such a negative light.ï»¿"
"Aeida Khamissi Although I agree about the book being toxic, remember this is a fucking book. It's not real, and it doesn't promote that being in a toxic relationship is okay. Every college and teenage relationship toxic, there is always fighting and yelling. This is a fucking book for god sake, its suppose to have drama to make it interesting, honestly, what did you expect. For them to fall in love without any fighting or hard points in their life, well sorry to break it to you but that is not how life works. They do fight a lot and it is toxic, but without it, it would be a boring ass book. Who would read a book with no drama??! If people can handle reading book about rape, bullying or being anorexic, then why can't people handle reading about a bad relationship. This shit happens all of the time and it teaches people lessons about life. The books ain't all toxic, they end up respecting each other and understand their flaws and fixing them. This book is relatable and puts people in the position to think. And the book is made for peoples enjoyment not to take it seriously. I am not attacking you, I am telling you its a book, not a real-life scenario. This had more positive stuff than negative, besides being toxic it teaches young teenagers to love yourself and your body, not to judge a book by its cover, not to trust everyone, life is not always perfect and much much more. I do agree with you at some points, but After is not garbage it is actually relatable, I honestly think that more people would agree with me. Not hating, I do agree with you I am just proving a point and showing that after is not garbage.ï»¿"

its legit only a teaserï»¿

a book duhï»¿
i need to read this book ASAPï»¿
Its so good!!ï»¿
This sounds like the plot of every Wattpad story.ï»¿
As a fan of the wattpad series and the revamped books I love that I can clearly see who is who and I canâ€™t wait to see it in theatres. People argue about the relationship being toxic but the sad reality is sooo many teen relationships especially in college are like this. Might not be your reality but itâ€™s someone elseâ€™s.ï»¿
"Omg! finally someone that agrees with me, I feel the exact way. I loved the book and although it was toxic at the start they grew as charactersï»¿"
"see if this movie goes the way i assume it is, this is going to be a very toxic movie, i feel they will romanticize this and people will think it is ok to live like this, it isnt and they should be showing people how to get out of these relationshipsï»¿"
"@Holly Kelly oh my fucking god I'm done with you, this doesn't romanticize toxic relationships, there's a difference between talking about it and romanticize it, if you haven't read the four books then don't come hereï»¿"
But what is this movie even gonna do? Show awareness? No. Because they are going to â€œfigure things outâ€ù and end up together. The message that itâ€™s going to end up sending is â€œstay in your toxic relationship because it works out in the endâ€ùï»¿
"Stalking* Funtime I mean that is the storyline of the books. I might just be a different type of consumer; because I know the relationship is far from ideal but its fictional. I think regardless of what they did to the script people could take different things away. I think it comes down to whoâ€™s watching. The story also alludes to Wuthering heights so much and the relationship portrayed there is toxic as well, but it still is  the centre of English literary curriculum. I donâ€™t promote toxic relationships but at the end I know itâ€™s a story that someone else can relate to on another level.ï»¿"
I feel so stupid lmfao but can you tell me who's who cause It's been so long and I've literally forgotten what some of their names got changed to (besides harry -> hardin) like what are the other guy's names now?ï»¿

The one thing that annoys me is that people are still comparing Jo and Hero (mainly Hero) to Harry and Indiana. The book on Wattpad compared to the printed book are different things (the names). And it gets annoying when they say how their relationship is â€œtoxicâ€ù. Thatâ€™s literally how most relationships are. And there probably wonâ€™t be as many sex scenes in the movie as it was in the book.ï»¿

Im an 1D fan since 2011 And I first read AFTER when not even the first book was complete and I have to say this: Guys chill when Anna wrote the Wattpad story she pictured Harry as Hardin in her mind  based in his apierence. It was a fan fiction! Then it turned into a book that was really good in my opinion and different from the wattpad version. Hero is not harry and thatâ€™s okay because who cares? heâ€™s HOT!

I wonder aswellï»¿
"I hate how this movie is so sexualized. They're high schoolers! It's okay to have one sex scene or two but this looks like 50 Shades of GreyÂ high school edition. Do the producers have any idea how many teenage kids will be watching this? A hoard of Wattpad fans will be flocking to see it. And mind you, I'm not some mom. I'm a 21-year-old female. I get that ""sex sells,"" but Jesus, this is outrageous. It looks like they'll be intimate for 70% of the movie! Sex shouldn't be so blatantly promoted to such a young audience. Sigh, I'm sure the movie will have its pros. But you don't need to be showing abs and boobs in every other scene to get good ratings. That's just desperate and toxic to the young minds who will be there to see it.ï»¿"

The books were so toxic. Literally just Harry being mentally abusive to Tessa and them having sex. That's it- that's the whole series.ï»¿
Remember that it is just a fan fic :)ï»¿
1D 4Ever it's not though. Not when you take into consideration how toxic they were and how the author tried to romanticize it. Keep in mind that many young girls read this book. What example does this set for them? That they have to settle for a guy who has sex with them because of a bet just because he's 'hot'?ï»¿
"anya ezra I mean Harry is not like that in real life. He will never treat a girl like he did in the fan fic. He is the most kindest person in the world and I donâ€™t think that he will ever beat a girl, because he is not that person you read about in the fan fic. (Btw sorry for my English. Iâ€™m from Sweden)ï»¿"

"There's a huge difference between talking about a toxic relationship and romanticize it or  supporte it, this is what the books are actually about,it shows you a toxic relationship but if you read them all you'll see that in the end they realized how toxic they are and  they take different ways, and they got back together just when they were mentally healthyï»¿"
Can I ask how it's toxic? I didn't finish the book _Ÿ˜…ï»¿

"I could rant about this horrendous â€œlove storyâ€ù but once Ms. Todd realizes that her story she wrote is toxic as hell for portraying relationships, this is gonna blow up in her face eventually!!!ï»¿"
"Need to state a few things;1. Harry Styles is NOT related to this movie anymore, he was once many years back, it's over now.2. Yes, this relationship is toxic but remember that they are teenagers, and they haven't matured yet but know that they will, soon.3. Hero and Harry aren't supposed to be compared. Hero is based off onto the published version of the book and Harry was just a fan fiction.4. Yes, this movie will have plenty of explicit scenes but remember, they are teenagers and they will mature, soon.5. This relationship starts off very toxic, but know that it's not always the same.6. Harry Styles has NOTHING to do with this movie anymore. (Yes, I've said that again)7. In the books, this relationship was more toxic but because of the public, they did change MANY things in this movie for it to be more appropriate for the audience.8. Not everyone will enjoy or understand this movie, it is not your typical cliche.9. If there really was a reason to hate on this movie based off of Harry Styles, there is no reason. Remember that this book was written by a girl many years ago that was barely known by ANYONE and started writing fan fiction (like a lot of Wattpad books these days). Later when the book got more attention and it got famous, it was pretty obvious that she couldn't keep the name Harry if she was going to publish it which is why it was changed to Hardin. Now when the movie is being released, the made sure to get rid of anything that the public eye wouldn't like, different from reading a book. 10. Know that this movie is now it's own, and it has no more link to anyone/ anything.Edit 1: so a lot of your comments are talking about how this movie is sO toxic a*nd I tried to minimize shit. Well, let me explain and there will be spoilers, so be warned. Hardin had a very shitty childhood, no father figure and his mother was also raped and he was there to witness the entire scene. He grew up with a fucked up mind and had nightmares every night. He wasn't mentally okay and needed help, but he always stayed away from therapy since he didn't want to change, he didn't want to become a better person because he knew he was fucked up and nobody could fix him. When Tessa comes into his life, he is still toxic because know that this movie is based on a bet and he didn't give a fuck about feelings back then cause he didn't care who he hurt. When he fucks Tessa's mind up, he realizes what he's been doing because he truly loved her. Throughout the book he tried to change for her and everyone else sO many times. And he succeeded plenty times too. In the second book he matured a LOT and so did Tessa and Hardin wasn't abusive the way he was. Know that there are 5 books, each book having it's own story and change to it. Hardin matured SO MUCH overtime and got therapy because Tessa had made him change his opinion on life. Hardin hated kids from the bottom of his heart but Tessa changed that and by the end (epilogue) they had children of their own. Hardin didn't like many things but Tessa always changed it for him and whenever he wasn't in a relationship with Tessa (broken up) he would do fucked up shit because he misses her and he knows what he did was wrong. Hardin was fucked up, Tessa came into his life, they messed each other up but soon enough, they grew and matured together and this relationship is NOT going to stay the way it looks like. If you haven't read the published version of the books then don't make predictions and talk about something you don't fully know about. The Wattpad version was written by a young woman when she wasn't even famous (know that so many people do that now) and Harry Styles is completely out of the picture but Anna still has the books up on Wattpad so her fellow fans that cannot afford the published version of the book and or don't have access to it, still can read the older version of After if they wish for.I must've spoiled you very hard but know that this book is based off something realistic, it's not some highschool first love and one issue breaks you apart and soon enough y'all get back together and get married. I don't understand why people like to see unoriginal overdone stuff over and over again and wouldn't wanna see something realistic. Much like 13rw spoke about Bullying, Suicide and Sexual Assault and many people didn't like seeing stuff nobody talks about. Insatiable, something many people didn't like seeing stuff that isn't usually talked about.Sorry for the rant, know that I'm defending the right reasons and your opinions are yours but please know that sometimes your opinions hurt people, it's better to stay quiet that way.Edit 2: if you gotta hate on something, shove it up your ass cause nobody gives a fuck.Edit 3: Calling me a stupid bitch or a slut isn't gonna change anything so maybe shove those comments up your ass as well.ï»¿"

"Don't try to minimize how toxic they are to each other. They're disgusting and mentally abusive, especially Hardin or Harry or whatever the fuckï»¿"
Hey what book is this based off? Never heard of it beforeï»¿
"@Amy McCall after, it's on wattpad and it's gross.ï»¿"
@anya ezra !!! YESï»¿
Love âù_ï»¿
â€œIsnâ€™t your typical clicheâ€ù lmao itâ€™s literally no different from every other cliche bad boy book on wattpad _Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
"@E well the ending is really different than any of those ""cliches"". I was actually going to stop reading it until I found out what was going on during the whole book and I had to finish it. It really goes there, that's all I'm going to sayï»¿"
"anya ezra aight you havenâ€™t read all of the books because in the last book, he changes and goes to therapy. he went from being someone so rude and toxic to someone completely opposite of that. thatâ€™s called character development, yâ€™all locals hating this book/movie and saying that it glorifies abusive and toxic relationships when rlly it shows that ppl can change and grow. if you donâ€™t like after thatâ€™s fine, but if yâ€™all gon hate yâ€™all need to at least get your facts straightï»¿"
"anya ezra I agree but at the same time, throughout the series, it shows how each character had developed and matured.ï»¿"
@Bob  ikrï»¿
Based on the trailer it's exactly your typical cliche though. I'm not seeing anything original about this.ï»¿
"Novruz Javadov you have to see the movie, bro. I swear, at least in the book, he is pretty much the most realistic prick youâ€™ll see in your life. And i mean this in the best way possible. Iâ€™m so done with films and series cookiecutting bad guys. In this book, they show it how it is. And the ending itâ€™s not at all what you expect.Of course for the movie they are going to sell it like this. At the end of the day, sex sells, you know?ï»¿"
honestly if people don't like it click out! stop hating & I agree with you!ï»¿
"Why are you defending something so clearly toxic?  ""Oh, but they're teenagers, they're not mature yet!!!"" So fucking what? What about the mainstream audience that is going to watch it, that won't make the connection that you mature with time, when the protagonists clearly won't? It's about putting front the right image so that girls won't have expectations that this is what a guy would treat them like in real life, or make guys think that this is what girls want. For crying out loud, have people learnt nothing from the Twilight train wreck? We just got rid of the toxicity that Fifty Shades was and now we get something even worse!ï»¿"
THANK YOU!!!ï»¿
"anya ezra There is 3 books. If itâ€™s possible, there will be 3 movies. In book one, yes I agree that they start off with a very toxic and abusive relationship. Iâ€™m not going to spoil anything, but the books are about character development, itâ€™s not your typical cliche. Iâ€™m not defending the fact that toxic relationships are okay because they absolutely arenâ€™t. Hardin later on learns to change for himself and not only for Tessa (the blonde girl).ï»¿"
"@xoNubia 0 exactly, if you just give the book a chance you'll see its actually like real life, people are not perfect but they develop and grow into a better person through time and that is what this book demonstrates. if people don't like it then they can just fuck off and stop hating on after.ï»¿"

Sara About time someone said it. From what I can tell by the film is that that really have changed/added stuffï»¿
"@Nicole Ntola yeah, i feel like if this was the other way around you wouldn't complain. Besides, fifty shades and the movies like it aren't for everyone. And thats what i think op means when they say it isn't cliche. Any other movie would have a manipulative, sadistic girl and a shy innocent boy character while movies like these show how doms and subs actually work. Besides, it's not as abusive in the movie. Hardin will probably be more gentle towards her near the end of the movie.ï»¿"
"Nicole Ntola though I completely understand where youâ€™re coming from, but if you havenâ€™t read the entire series, you shouldnâ€™t be putting your judgement through this. And claiming that many girls will follow after the protagonistâ€™s steps because of a movie thatâ€™s based on a fictional book seems a bit of a reach considering the fact that this film is made for entertainment purposes, not to teach girls OR men that you can have the ability to change someone. And Iâ€™ve also read somewhere that there have been a few changes to the film and hopefully this will make you more at ease because itâ€™s been assumed that because of the small changes in the film, the film will portray Tessa and Hardinâ€™s relationship in a different light.ï»¿"
"Xenoghost this book was published and is in the young adult section, tell me exactly how could a ten year old child get their hands on this book? And brainwashed? Thatâ€™s out of line, donâ€™t you think?ï»¿"

Sara yeah but all us OG readers are like â€œHarryâ€ùï»¿
No matter your age you shouldn't be in a toxic relationship... and that's the problem with this book/movie that the girl always stayed by his side no matter how toxic he was... at least I hope girls can understand that from this movie and not the oppositeï»¿
"@Sanuvar Sultana I just hope girls   won't stay in toxic relationships just because they think they can 'change' the guy... but also that's not something that should be learned from a movie, I hope the movie can actually have a nice message to young people about how toxic relationships are not a good thing !ï»¿"
"Harry was never related, only his named was used but I bet he doesn't even know about thatï»¿"
Isa10 they were only toxic at first n throughout the book u can see that they realise their mistakes n try to be better n also fight for each otherï»¿
"100% agree with you, girl. THANK YOU.ï»¿"
Iâ€™m pretty sure their relationship remains toxic throughout the whole series lmaoï»¿
Jamie n Iâ€™m pretty sure youâ€™re wrongï»¿
Why are people talking about Harry Styles?ï»¿
Naguevona el testamento que exageraciÃ_nï»¿
"Sanuvar Sultana he would harass her, make her cry constantly, made her uncomfortable, and would always have anger issues for no reason. You support that but I'm the local? Try again. His development started books later. All the damage he did can't be redeemed by that. In real life you know that shit wouldn't stand. It's called knowing your worth and having self respect.ï»¿"
"For those of you who don't know Harry (in the Wattpad original) made a bet with his friends that he could have sex with good girl Tessa (since she was a prude those assholes that this would be funny or cool or idk what was going on through their deranged brains.) Harry decides to go through with the dare whistle in the proses abusing her mentality and physically. Still somehow he gets Tessa to have sex with him and then he shows his friends the proof that they had sex and embarrassed her in front of them. After that he has the audacity to tell her that he is in love with her.Keep in mind that this is only in the first book.That's what some of the dumbasses in the comments are trying to excuseï»¿"
Justifying being toxic by saying â€œtheyâ€™re just teenagersâ€ù or â€œthey havenâ€™t matured yetâ€ù sets the idea that itâ€™s acceptable to be toxic if you are still a teenager but really that shouldnâ€™t ever be okay no matter what. And the fact the later on he is completely dependent on her for being a good person means that their relationship is still toxic since heâ€™s only a good person for her and is completely dependent on her for it. Toxic relationships are never ever okay or acceptable no matter whatï»¿
So what's the book?ï»¿
YES GO OFF!!_Ÿ‘è_Ÿè__Ÿ‘è_Ÿè__Ÿ‘è_Ÿè_ï»¿
Reï»¿
"Girl, I totally agree with you. See, this is a one minute teaser, not the full trailer. What you see here, is in no way anything you can expect from this movie. And the funny thing is, people are gonna see this movie anyway, just so they can say shit about it - well, I don't give a fuck, when you go and see this movie, we will get the second one, so you'll just make us happy. I hate to see how people think Fifty Shades of Grey is ''good'' and ''different'', yet, how toxic was that ? This book is so different from anything I've ever read. And you know why? Because I read all the books, because I didn't just read the first one. Because I didn't listen to what people told me about this book, I just went and read it to see for myself. The first book is just the start of something huge, a very emotional yet romantic rollercoaster. Yes, the first book has toxic elements. But that's exactly what Anna Todd (the writer) wanted to show. Some people are toxic. Some relationships start off toxic. There are people with shitty childhoods and trauma's, it fucks up who they are. There are people who can't love anyone. And Anna Todd wanted to show people what effect people can have on people. Tessa changed Hardin, in ways he never thought possible. And you guys have no clue how, because none of these haters have read every single word of the five books out there. You're basing your opinion on opinions you've heard on social media, on reading a few chapters, on reading the first book but nothing more, on the fact that this is ''based off a boyband and it's a fanfiction''. Who the fuck cares??? Aside from the fact that the only thing about One Direction she ever used were their names and their looks, I have a surprise for you, Fifty Shades was based off of Twilight: A FANFICTION. To All The Boys I've Loved Before, The Kissing Booth, Fifty Shades - they're all fanfiction turned into movies. The difference? This writer chose to discuss something that's different from other fanfiction for teenagers. She chose to discuss REAL PROBLEMS THAT SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY GO THROUGH. Do I like Tessa and Hardin's relationship in the first book? God, no. I hate how Hardin drives her mad. I hate the influence he's got on her. I hate his intentions. BUT THAT'S THE POINT. Hate him! He's fucked up. You're hating him as much as Tessa does at first, as much as Noah does, as much as Tessa's mom does. You're hating Hardin as much as he hates himself. But that changes. The story changes. The intentions change. Hardin changes. Tessa changes. In the other books, it's not even about their mental influence on each other anymore. It's about who they are - and about who Tessa and Hardin help each other to become. But y'all haters didn't know this, did you? No, cause you've never even cared to read the whole story to understand anything about this. If you hate it so much and refuse to understand the story, then LEAVE. Don't watch this movie, don't watch this teaser, don't talk to the fandom. Don't bother, go somewhere else. If it's so bad, do all of us a favor and just leave. This movie is becoming a thing anyway and you can't do anything about it. Go give hate to something that actually deserves hate. Good day, everyone.ï»¿"
Mileyforlifex I couldnâ€™t have said it better myself.ï»¿
First off 13rw and insatiable are terrible show instead of being positive there actually hating people. DO NOT even compare them to this book. The wattpad version is trash and spoiler alert in the wattpad version Hardin rapes her in the second book. I read the book version and it was WAY better the wattpad version but still HORRIBLE. You can blame a toxic relationship on age or blame on the past. Itâ€™s just sad that people thinks it â€œcouple goalsâ€ù.ï»¿
How jobless are you.ï»¿

"""it is nothing like your typical clichÃ©""*stares at every YA romance book ever published in the last 10 years *ï»¿"
"Well they aren't really teenagers, they're in college. Tessa is 18 (yeah still Young Tho) and Hardin is around 20/21ï»¿"
"For me I love the story of AFTER books, it happen in real life,there is a big lesson on this story,for those who grow up with tough life they will understand this story and they will inspire to never give up to their lives.just observe your surroundings what happen and what are they doing,I know you donâ€™t give a fuck for their lifeâ€™s,but donâ€™t judge each people bcoz we donâ€™t know what theyâ€™ve been through each day especially this book AFTER.ï»¿"
ok i get what you said here. the thing is jts always the same... bad boy fells in love with a good girl.. isnt it right?ï»¿
S S yes your right_Ÿ˜_ï»¿
anya ezra THANKS FOR SPEAKING THE TRUTHï»¿
"Well i dont need to write that much, I just hv one thing to say: junkï»¿"
"The fact that they're teenagers doesn't justify a toxic relationship. Furthermore, they aren't teenagers, they're in college so I think both of them are mature enough to think and do things with resposibility and how to treat other people with respect.And, I know maybe this will break your little heart but this is completely a clichÃ©. Good girl meets a bad boy. If you have read tipical YA books, you will know what I'm talking about.From my point of view, preadolescent girls who read this kind of books will normalize this type of relationship. Yeah, the guy changes and grows but this is exactly the point. Some people are justifying his acts saying that, they're accepting the fact that he was an absolutely asshole with her.I don't wanna offend you but yeah, this is what I think (sorry about my english, I'm not native:)).ï»¿"
AFTER is before all the wattpad stories.ï»¿
I stopped reading after the second time you said â€œthey are teenagers who havenâ€™t matured yetâ€ùï»¿
anya ezra he didnâ€™t even have anger issues. He was an Asshole at first yes ik that but at least the Book shows how a dickhead actually acts unlike other romance novels. He became that asshole bc of his fÃ»cked up childhood which was caused by his parents mistakes so itâ€™s not his fault. Hardin did not know he made Tessa cry at first but when he did he tried to comfort her. Tbh I prolly would not forgive Hardin if I were Tessa but she did forgive bc she believes that Hardin can change which did happen so this shows that u should nvr give up on someone even if theyâ€™re as fucked up as Hardin. my point is this book shows real life problems n mistakes n shit u do for love(sounds cheesy as fuck but itâ€™s the truth) which makes it realisticï»¿
"after reading ALL OF THIS itÂ´s sad that you decided to ad that ""edit 2"", you seemed poised and mature until you sent people to shove things up their asses instead of ignoring them...as you said: ""it's better to stay quiet""ï»¿"
"@Christian UreÃ±a I completely agree with you, that edit really made me realize that this comment comes off more of a fan trying to excuse the movie/wattpad book versus the understanding manner I originally felt.ï»¿"
Take a sitï»¿
"anya ezra also about when he shows his friends proof that they had sex: first of all I think that nothing can justify his actions for doing that. But like I said he was fucked up n thought that by doing that he would get his â€˜friendsâ€™ off his back n not disturb his n Tessaâ€™s relationship but obviously it didnâ€™t work.   He also instantly regretted showing his friends the proof n said â€˜I felt like vomiting aft doing thatâ€™(not exactly what he said but smth like that)when he said he loved her, it was the fucking truth not a lie. Ik thereâ€™s no way what I said can justify his actions but like I said he was fucked up n is prolly a certified Asshole bc of his childhood so     He does stupid, fucked up things like that. But in the end he became a better person completely n learned from his mistakes n I think that thatâ€™s all that matters.ï»¿"
Just noï»¿
"@cunther It's not ""as abusive""... Are you even listening to yourself? Why does anything have to be abusive, especially when it's romanticized?Also, if it was the other way around I ""wouldn't complain""? Explain to me why I would support abusive behaviour and toxic relationships? It doesn't matter who does it, this shit is still toxic.ï»¿"
"@Nicole Ntola yeah that's the issue. It's still abuse nonetheless. Nobody in hollywood bats an eye when girls portray this behavior but the moment a man does it it's suddenly a problem, sorry if i'm making it about gender but it's something that i've noticed.ï»¿"
"@mel oxs In all due respect, that's how the movie industry works. Everything is made for entertainment purposes, but the audience still picks up the ideals that the movies promote. The same thing happenned with Twilight. We all remember that time, right? Well, those of us old enough to understand do. The movie was based off a highly toxic book, and though it was made for mon...ahem, entertainment, the ideals that passed through to the girls were clear. It's all about how the audience perceives the messages that are given. Sure, older and/or mature viewers will understand that Hardin is an asshole to Tessa (yes, I've read the books, to my greatest regret) but what about the ones that don't? It doesn't matter if the movie makes Hardin 'less' abusive. Any percentage of abusive is terrible in a relationship and it shouldn't be romanticized. Take it from one who knows.ï»¿"
"""IT IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL CLICHÃ‰"" HAHAHAHHA YES, IT IS! OF COURSE IT IS!ï»¿"
"@cunther That's the thing though, is it? Hollywood would never make an abusive main character female, because that would mean a woman would be shown as more powerful than the man. I'm not saying that Hollywood should start making movies starting abusive women (yuck) but the thing is that the world is overstuffed with abuse towards women in the media, and we don't need another one, especially when the creators think they're doing the audience a favour when one character is less of an asshole to the protagonist than he is in th book.ï»¿"
"if I were to compare their relationship with a normal relationship itâ€™s actually not that different just more intense n fucked up. In a normal relationship when the guy/girl messes up smth, itâ€™s normal for the girl/guy to go back to the guy/girl that messed up bc he/she still loves the guy/girl that fucked up. So if u say that Hardinâ€™s n Tessaâ€™s relationship is toxic bc he hurt her or keep fucking up n she keep forgiving him for the mistakes he made, does that mean that most real life relationships r toxic?ï»¿"
"Sara itâ€™s a gross wattpad fic written by a married woman which makes it way more creepier and in the book didnâ€™t hardin take the bloody sheets from tessaâ€™s first time and show it to his friends... the book itâ€™s based on is disgusting and you shouldnâ€™t be trying this hard to defend it, there are plenty of good reasons to hate on this movieï»¿"
"May I know the name of the author please Iâ€™m really trying to read the books, this trailer has me sooo hooked. Thank youâù_ï¸èï»¿"
i don't see why it matters that they are teenagers. the damage from a toxic relationship can occur at any age and abusers deserve to be held accountable at any age.ï»¿
""" When he fucks Tessa's mind up, he realizes what he's been doing because he truly loved her"" this sentence right here, undermines any of the excuses you just gave. I don't understand how the ""its realistic"" excuse works either. We all want realistic stories. We don't want the toxic parts of real life to be romanticized. I don't want teenagers to see this relationship and think ""oh, its okay if i go through a toxic relationship like this, because soon it'll turn out romantic and he'll change for me. I just need to stick with it."" That's an incredibly dangerous and disgusting message to send to people.ï»¿"
"@Sanuvar Sultana It does glorify. It sends the message ""hey, if your boyfriend is abusive and your relationship is toxic, you just need to WAIT IT OUT, you just need to try your hardest to change him and eventually everything will get better"". What any realistic story should be telling people about their abusive toxic relationships is to LEAVE. DO NOT TRY AND CHANGE YOUR ABUSERS. DO NOT WAIT IT OUT.ï»¿"
"@ally victims of toxic relationships should not be told to ""wait and hope they change"". It's abuse. Don't tell victims to wait for them to change and ask them to endure the abuse until its better.ï»¿"

Kamcum 07 so just because he had a shitty childhood it's acceptable to treat others like shit? You're delusional. If you love someone you would never EVER hurt them like that- there are NO EXCUSES.

"Are you even real girls? When someone treats you like this, you have to RUN, not to wait for him to change because you think it's love. It's not, not from you neither form him. You have to leave him and report it to police (yes, I mean the rape scene, I don't care some if it was just in the wattpad version, she wrote it and let their story exist).In times like our we have to teach what it's the right thing to do, not to stay by his side hoping for the best ""because he loves you"".It's not a good book. Like it was not a good book Twilight or 50 shades or Beautiful disaster and similiar.You can't pretend these relationships were romance. They were toxic, all of them. And the books are shitty.Thinking otherwise is just wrong. Open your mind.Try to read a good book, not something that was a fanfiction once. Maybe you'll see the difference. Leave arguments like rape, or toxic relationship, violent partner, stalking, psycological tratement, anger issues, abortion to a real writer. Not to bored housewifes.And about clichÃ©? All YA are made of them. After too. Ah and I read the books. Unfortunately.Toxic romance and awfully written.ï»¿"

"Rebecca Intaschi 1.she did try to run away from him multiple times but keep coming back to him.

THERE WAS NO RAPE SCENE BTW HARDIN N TESSA. I have no idea where u got that info from but itâ€™s wronggggï»¿"
"Ok it's definitely cliche. Just because there is a lot of character development and toxicity doesn't make it any different. You might be a fan but if you read any other book on Wattpad with the boy or the girl having a dark past? You'd know how cliche this book is. Don't get me started on the writing style either. Realistic? My ass. It's like they are the only people with the darkest of past everything is wrong with just the main of the characters. There were others too but this book was just some toxic love driven book. Honestly, stop being biased just because you like it.ï»¿"

@Amy McCall Girl it's from wattpad.ï»¿
"Wow sis thank you for this, lets see if people understand and stop calling people who actually like the book ""sluts""ï»¿"
kamcum 07 Iâ€™m like pretty sure he has insecurity and drinking issues throughout the second and third book and they have major co-dependency issues to the point where they can barely function without each other so.... yeah.ï»¿
Sara I bet u know one read alllll of this but liked it for ur effortï»¿
"There are many characters with bad parents and bad childhoods who are non-toxic. Unfortunately, the personality of After's characters sucks. Also, it's not because they are teenagers that we have to swallow bad behaviors. It's precisely because many teenagers will watch this (and read, in case) that the characters should not be like that. Toxic relationships are not cool, even more romanticized. That sucks.ï»¿"
@Mileyforlifex I just wanna hug u right now. Agreed with every single wordï»¿
@nyahnicole think u read the wrong book on wattpad. I am pretty sure I read the wattpad version and books more than you and in more depth and detail to know for sure that there was never any fucking rape in itï»¿
"@kamcum 07 and that's good, I just read the first and second book I think but I'm going to watch the movie so I'll see what happens!ï»¿"
@nyahnicole people saying 'I need a Hardin' damn!! I'm worried about them lolï»¿
"@Keren Kokia in a book I remember she was drunk and they had sex so people started to say it was rape, but later that also happened with him too, this time with him being drunk... so idk maybe they raped each other _Ÿ˜…ï»¿"
"Im gonna start by saying that I have not read the Wattpad book, the published final copy, or intend upon seeing this movie when it comes out in a year. This is an outside perspective looking in on a story that I dont know that much about and therefore, I am going to only be using what you said above in what I say next... I've read some of the other comments on this thread and I find that a lot people are saying that the story is based around character development. Hardin (or something, sorry _Ÿ˜_) goes from being abusive and toxic towards the main female, Tessa, in the first book to being loving and mature in the final book. I completely agree with what these people are saying; the story (based on your comment above) definitely shows character development. Changing from toxic to loving is definitely character development. I have abosolutly no problem with this argument. The second most popular comment I see in this thread is that Tessa and Hardin are teenagers and are learning to mature together through experimentation and correct ways to do things and incorrect ways to do things. Above you stated that as the books continue, Hardin becomes more mature. But then you also stated that Hardin throws a fit when Tessa and him break up, around the same time you said they were maturing. Maturity is being able to control your emotions in scary situations; in that moment in time, Hardin was not being mature. At all. In fact, violent outbursts are very common in toxic relationships... But hey, they're maturing. I would not categorize flipping out when your partener leaves you a sign that the one flipping actually cares and loves you, but hey. They're maturing. The final comment that I have seen a lot of is that this story is much more preferable able over a sappy Hallmark movie because its more realistic. Empathise on realistic. This type of relationship is only normal if you let it be normal. From what I saw in the trailer and in your comment above, Hardin is the one in charge, it seems, when it comes to the sexual activities. I understand Tessa consented, I gotchu. BUT, a yes doesnt always mean yes, you get my drift? Anytime there is any sort of power struggle or power loss in one of the consenting adults, youve already lost the battle. They're not equal and thats just from this trailer alone. This type of relationship is NOT normal; its only normal if we, as a society, make it normal. I understand it might seem realistic to some, becahse theyre (Tessa and Hardin) still maturing and are just exploring the ways of love together, one sexual activity after another. Sex is not love. This couple is not happy (maybe Hardin is because he doesnt understand what love is [because of his parents]). My final point I will make is just based on my observations from the trailer. I would like to go on record and say that I am a 16 year old girl and I felt morbidly creeped out by the ages of these kids in the movie. They look young. And this movie will probably be rated teen. Thats a BIG problem. To prevent abuse, we need to stop showing it as a form of entertainment. I know what you are about to say... ""The story isnt about abuse. Its about all the stuff I already said above."" Yes, I understand this. But, whether we like to admit or not, Hardin low key hurt her repeatedly (this is just from all the stuff Ive gathered from the comments). I... Just dont want anymore kids, female and/or male to think that sexual contact this much along with some abusive behavior (like throwing a fit and falling into a depression like you said above) is okay. Its not. Im sorry, but its not. If I was Tessa in this situation, I would have left the first time he had ever said or done anything to hurt me mentally or physically. She could help build up his life by encouraging to go to therapy instead of just allowing him to use her as a sex toy. I hope they change the rating on this movie, that's all I have to say.Btw: you're not a slut or a bitch. You just have an option and some people (including myself) have a different option on the same topic.  I respect that. Again, take everything I say with a grain of salt because I havent read any of the books... But anywho, thats my rant. Cookies for everyone! _Ÿçª _Ÿçª _Ÿçªï»¿"
@Isa10 she was drunk and they had sex yes but she was still very aware of what she is doing and it was very much consentual. I urge u to read it more clearly next time. She actually annitiated it as well. If she was unconscious or he drugged her and then did stuff to her yes I would agree with u but she was slightly drunk and annitiated the whole thing. I don't think that rape. And Hardin has never phsiaclly harmed her ever. Yes verbally. But never physically so the whole rape thing I just falseï»¿

I salute this person wowï»¿
"it literally amazes me how you guys would defend this and come up with arguments, like you really think you're making any sense.. listen WOMEN ARE NOT REHABILITATION CENTERS, THEY ARE NOT HERE TO ""SAVE"" FUCKED UP MEN. that's what you guys don't get. they're selling you this idea that ""the right woman"" could make a man change for good, hello ?? that's not what women are for and this is in no way insensitive towards the fucked up kid because it's actually sad and shit but using that as an excuse to abuse a girl mentally and emotional and SEXUALLY, yes, sexually! you can't act like it's okay that the whole thing was a bet or whatever lol that's fucked up and u used it thinking it was a good argument, cmon it's not fair to her, don't you see that? also they're literally kids for fuck's sake, and don't try to justify shit, we all know you just get off to this shit, and it doesn't matter all the things you said about the author because at the end of the day it's a self inserted fic and the idea came up beacause she actually fantasized about Harry Styles being a shitty piece of dumb fuck to her lmao and that's because media has been selling this premise since forever. also i think that HS has spoken negatively about this shit and he's damn right, and you're wrong because at the end of the day people WILL link him to this shit anyway.also, you mentioned shit like 13rw like it's a good example lmao but guess what; that's another piece of shit and it's triggering, that's the problem, and it's not save, it has not warning or age restrictions whatsoever and it's not addressing mental health in a HEALTHY way, in a HELPFUL way at all. it's not representation; it only trivializes and romanticizes mental health.and also, the other problem here is that the author wasn't a kid when she wrote this, but i'm not shaming her or anything, and she can do whatever she wants with however her creativity works and i'm sure there are tons of fucked up fanfiction that would never compared to this in any level but she, an almost 30 year old woman, CHOSE to publish this. chose to make money out of this, she is an adult who CHOSE to sell this to kids and no matter how hard you try to prove this isn't about Harry Styles, the reality is that she sold this shit and made money exactly because it was about Harry Styles. the problem is not that she wrote this shit; the problem is that she doesn't see anything wrong with it; she actually believes that this ""right-girl-saves-a-fucked-up-boy-but-mainly-got-interested-in-him-because-he's-hot-and-now-he-treats-her-like-shit-but-she-hopes-she-can-change-him"" is okay, like she (and you apparently) don't give a shit about women at all, like let me give you a few thing to consider before defending this shit: in real life, this kind of shit does not end up in happy ever after; it ends up in more and more abuse, it ends up in femicide. women are not rehabilitation centers!! they're just not, that's so incredibly misogynist actually,  and archaic, wake the fuck up. it doesn't matter how fucked up a person can be, that's not a good reason to abuse another person.  really , fan fiction is okay and i'm not judging but i just personally think that this fucked up self indulgent book doesn't deserve attention, doesn't deserve to be sold as TEENAGE LOVE, it's not fair. also i think there are tons of fics that could do better than this joke of a film. like I've read some good shit, very original and safe. this shit was long and i don't expect you to read it bc there's like 100+ comments but there you goï»¿"

PREACH WOMAN PREACHï»¿
"The reason why this is not as cliche as other books on Wattpad is because it's more realistic something you can relate to. Yes it's the normal bad boy good girl situation but it's a different take on it. One that can actually experienced in real life. This relationship is not perfect nor will it ever be, but it's still beautiful in many ways. Haters judge just from THE TRAILER. Like insatiable or 13 reasons why. Nobody liked the reality of the show. Saying that it ""glorified"" or ""encouraged"" some sick things but really the two shows were trying to prove a point. And keep in mind if you don't like watching something don't waste your patience by watching it.ï»¿"
@Nicole Ntola please read the books.ï»¿
slay!!!!!ï»¿
"Sara Wait....I'm too old to watch this movie or to be a Harry fan, but i think i know of the fanfiction author you're referring to because someone my age reviewed it as an opinion peice on sex in popular culture. If this is true, then I'm very upset to know this insipid tripe saw success. i feel like shit now. I cant stand to think i never wrote my book when this garbage is getting famous.ï»¿"
I read the 3 installment book of it and I love itï»¿
"Julienne Kate Uy Iâ€™m going to assume that youâ€™re not in high school if you think those are examples of how real life is for teenagers. I graduated high school this year and I can tell you that it is no where near as dramatic as a lot of popular media will have you believe. Especially instaiable. Iâ€™ll admit I watched that entire show because it was entertaining but I can also admit that it was a giant piece of flaming garbage. Insatiable is not an accurate representation of high school at all, nor was it meant to be. Itâ€™s satirical, the show is making fun of itself. And the fact that you use that as an example of a realistic show is really indicative of how warped your sense of â€œrealityâ€ù is. I will also say that I did read the after series when I was about 14 , again because it was pretty entertaining. But just like with I insatiable I can admit that this series is pure trash. The writing is terrible and the story is so cliche and so unrealistic.  In real life toxic relationships arenâ€™t romantic, they are scary as fuck and should be portrayed as such. Iâ€™m not saying that youâ€™re not allowed to like the series. You can like it all you want, just donâ€™t pretend that this story is something that it isnâ€™t. This story is not that deep yâ€™all.ï»¿"
"Sara excuses unhealthy and abusive relationships because they are teens Come on now.ï»¿"
"Also to all of you who love this book and think itâ€™s so amazing. I beg you to please some actual good young adult books. Books that have substance and real character development, rather than relying on sex and cliches to drive the story. Here are some recommendations:-Iâ€™ll give you the sun by Jandy Nelson-on the jellicoe road by Melina Marchetta -fangirl by rainbow rowell-since youâ€™ve been gone by Morgan mats on-just one day by gayle Forman-we were liars by e Lockhart-to all the boys Iâ€™ve lived before by Jenny Han ^ these are all great young adult novels with I hope some of you take an chance and read some of themï»¿"
"@Keren Kokia A drunk person can't give consent. Doesn't matter how bad they say they want it, if they intoxicated, they're not in ANY position to make such a crusial choice because it could lead to something they regret. Tessa saying that she was aware of her so called ""choice"" doesn't justify anything. One time I was tipsy and cut my hand deep by accident. I knew it happenned and that I had to do something about it, but I couldn't realize the severity of the situation in that moment. Hardin took advantage of Tessa's inability to make a clear and lucid choice and that can be qualified as a sex offence.ï»¿"
"â€‹@Agustina Guanes Justifying and idealizing abuse, toxic realtionships and potential sex offences isn't qualified as a ""their own taste"" only.ï»¿"
"COMPLETELY AGREE! GOOD SAID GIRL! I hate critical people, they just dont understand and Hardin needs to be read and understood, heÂ´s a very developed character with lots of traumas. I also hate extreme HarryÂ´s fans saying this film disrespects him, I mean... when? In any case, After were created from admiration and love, just like any other fan fact. And IÂ´m a huge fan of Harry too but I can understand After has evolve in many ways and Harry is not related anymore. Now Hardin is HERO and he is just as perfect.ï»¿"
"@Harley J Fuck off, huh? Well, leaving aside the fact that you're probably a pissed off 14 year old who lacks creativity when it comes to insults, if you also me that your url is the way it is to 'honour' Harley Quin's relationship with Mister J, then what can I say?

"Let's just clarify one thing: It doesn't matter if something is realistic or not. I love when forms of entertainment are realistic because it becomes much more tolerable and even enjoyable. These books romanticized abuse and yes it was abuse and in the second book, rape. You can enjoy it all you want. Nobody's trying to stop you from that or for even being excited. But don't get mad at people for pointing out the truth or for preferring to see movies with happy couple who don't fight because unrealistic as it might be, it's healthier than romanticizing a toxic and abusive relationship and then marketing it to young, impressionable girls.ï»¿"

"Aside from the fact that a book which is unworthy of being called ""novel"" is now a film... The actor who plays Hardin doesn't fit his role. The actor is handsome, but his appereance seems totally different from Hardin's one. Plus, he looks like a good, sweet boy, but he should be a ""bad boy"" to play Hardin.I'm curious to see how this film turned out. How can a book full of sex scenes be a film? It would probably be a porn movie, not a movie. I also think that this whole situation is kinda ridiculous. There are so many beautiful, interesting books out there, and they choose the most dreadful. C'mon people, After is full of violence, people who have sex even if they don't love each other, awful parents-children relationships... However, Anna Todd is a good writer, she is strong on writing. After plot is very interesting and it could have been a very good book if it had been shortened and rewritten, mantaining the ""basic plot"" only. The plot is not banal: a bad boy who has been through hell who falls in love with a good girl who has suffered in her life. If it were developed in a better way, than it would be a good novel. But Anna Todd is still young, she will go on and I think she will be able to write a beautiful story. However that's only my two cents on it.ï»¿"

"itstheemcat donâ€˜t make assumptions about me since you donâ€˜t know anything about what Iâ€˜m like. Let me ask you something, have you read all five books? And if so, why would you write a comment like that? Hardin didnâ€˜t physically abuse Tessa. Bold of you to just assume that i have a lack of empathy for abuse survivors since i personally know someone whoâ€˜s been through major abuse. Might I add that Iâ€˜m a really empathic person. But thereâ€˜s a difference between fiction and real life. I know some people have a hard time seeing the fine line between fiction and rl, but not me. If youâ€˜re not able to make out the fine line, then yes, this movie isnâ€˜t for you. If you donâ€˜t like it, donâ€˜t watch it. Simple, isnâ€˜t it? And yes, I will support this movie since I really like the casting and the general idea behind the plot. But that doesnâ€˜t mean I support toxic and abusive relationships.ï»¿"
"ruby kj Actually I know why those people are offended. I just donâ€˜t see the point in criticizing something before watching it. And all these offended people may have only heard of after but have never read it themselves. Donâ€˜t judge a book by its cover. Yes, this relationship isnâ€˜t something to look up to most of the time, but having read all books and looking back, they have come far. And no, Iâ€˜m not trying to defend Hessa but this is just a trailer and the movieâ€˜s gonna come out one way or another .ï»¿"

@Breiana i fuck with the fangirls bc this is a very serious problem in society you know that millions of women die bc they were in a toxic relationship and they thought that it was love? if it hurts its not fucking love and its not funny to normalize this shit of romance. i seriously cant believe that people still cant see the difference between love and abuse and the main reason is bc of this bullshit that yall the fangirls of this call true LOVEï»¿

"Sae E Sae E well said, Iâ€™m just here for the story itself, not for living out my fantasy dream with celebrity, not for showing that I really support and tolerate the abusive and toxic relationship. only those who are stupid enough to actually watch or read After and normalize the toxic and abusive relationship. Also to haters: itâ€™s childish to have negative judgement or bash to the After Fans. If After is not ur cup of tea, then donâ€™t watch the teaser, donâ€™t go comment on anything After relate just to spread more hates cause no matter what the movie is already filmed and will show in April 2019, your hates wonâ€™t matter anymore. So save yourself sometimes and spend ur energy on something else beside spreading hates.ï»¿"

Totally respect your opinion but just wanted to point out itâ€™s not â€œbased off Harryâ€ù it was just a piece of fiction using his face. Was never meant to be portraying his character in real life.ï»¿
Katie's Lens itâ€™s not based on Harry styles sis just stop. Harry is only the face of the character. Use common sense nowï»¿
sumaya .12 wasnâ€™t this book a 1D fan fiction before the characters were changed for publishing?ï»¿
victoria clark yesï»¿
"sumaya .12 go away, before he was â€œHardinâ€ù the character was literally Harry. a lot of people donâ€™t like poor Harry now because of this bookâ€™s portrayal of him.ï»¿"
"Katie's Lens sis you donâ€™t think I know that try again Iâ€™ve been a one direction fan since the beginning. And I donâ€™t think you are registering the fact that HE ISNT HARRY. Yes it was a fan fiction but thatâ€™s simply what it is FICTION. The Harry in the book was not even close to what Harry is like in real life as you mentioned. So what does that mean? Harry was only used as a face for the character. Itâ€™s not that difficult to understand. And instead of saying â€œgo awayâ€ù you should learn to come up with better arguments, are you 10?ï»¿"
Katie's Lens well those people should probs do their research on the meaning of FICTION. Thatâ€™s on them if they want to believe thatâ€™s how Harry acts in real life _Ÿ___Ÿè»â€çâ™€ï¸è_Ÿ_·_Ÿè_â€çâ™€ï¸èï»¿

Judith Fangirl01 I promise you sis people are not being confused by the two. And if they are theyâ€™re too young to be reading those books anywaysï»¿
sumaya .12 actually it confuses me a bit I mean when it says the characters name Harry styles or justin bieber or Noah Centineo etc I canâ€™t help but picture the actual person Iâ€™m used to Iâ€™m sorry I know this defeats your point but some people like myself actually get them confused witch is why I donâ€™t read fan fics based on real peopleï»¿
"sumaya .12 sumaya .12 for the record, Iâ€™ve been a fan since the beginning, too. i saw 1d twice and Harry and Niall during the summer. iâ€™m perfectly aware Hardin is not harry, and harry is just a face for him. i simply stated my opinion and didnâ€™t ask for you to attack me. I said go away because i donâ€™t feel like arguing. the after series is toxic and romanticizes abusive relationships and i was meaning to say that i feel bad that people associate Harry irl with Hardin.ï»¿"
who do you know who hated on harry because of this book ?ï»¿
A Mariahxo personally I havenâ€™t seen anyone hate on Harry based off the book so idk why people are saying that.ï»¿
It was originally written as fanfiction.. do you understand the meaning of that word? lolï»¿
"Katie's Lens you didnâ€™t mention that â€œyou felt bad for people that associate Harry irl with Hardinâ€ù you said that the character is based off of Harry which implies that they have similar traits. Which they donâ€™t. And yes the series has toxic aspects but as the story developed you can see the character development as well. People that havenâ€™t read the series would know that. And Iâ€™m sorry if you thought I was attacking you, I wasnâ€™t. Iâ€™m a fan of the series and some arguments are weak causing the movie to have a stigma before itâ€™s even released.ï»¿"
victoria clark I guess itâ€™s different for everyone then. But to me thatâ€™s a little odd just because itâ€™s obviously not that character. And they changed his name and everything in the movie so I donâ€™t see how itâ€™s possible for anyone to get confused.ï»¿
sumaya .12 Exactlyï»¿
sumaya .12 for me since Iâ€™m so used to seeing names like Harry styles justin bieber and etc Iâ€™m to used to thinking of them when I see or hear their names in something so thatâ€™s why itâ€™s hard for me to not think of them when reading their names in a storyï»¿
"Katie's Lens Harry in After and Harry in real life are not the same person. One is a BOOK CHARACTER and the other is the actual person. Fan fiction is a platform for using celebrity faces and names in a fake reality, FICTION means not true. And Harry knows about after, Iâ€™m the beginning when Anna Todd announced the movie being filmed a few years ago, Harry was on board of the idea of playing Hardin but due to projects he was working on that sadly didnâ€™t happen. And the book has nothing to do with how people view him. So if you have nothing nice to say about the movie, please keep it to your self and allow us #AfterMovie fans to enjoy the happiness  this movie will bring to our lives this upcoming Aprilï»¿"
Hardin is not based off harry hardin in the bookï»¿
â€œwith psychological issuesâ€ù should not be considered as an insult...ï»¿
@Judith Fangirl01 Anna used their faces for the basis of how she wrote in NO way she was portraying them like worse then they are....  it's called fiction for a reason....(aka make believe)ï»¿
"Fanfiction is fiction, it in no way reflected what Harry is as a person. Also the books aren't that bad it sure did show the main character as a very toxic, disturbed individual in the beginning and mostly throughout the book but ki t shows the growth as well, and. Don't ruin it for people who actually like it.ï»¿"
"sumaya .12 Lmao youâ€™re up and down these comments. We get it... you support abusive ships like this crap. Majority of people donâ€™t - accept that and stop bitching it. Fuck, fangirls like you are vile.ï»¿"
Uhmm....it's an AU.... Don't take it so seriously it's just a character... nothing else... _Ÿ’™_Ÿ’_ï»¿
I actually get to know Harry Styles coz of this book..now im a Harries..ï»¿
"Well, Anna wrote these books on wattpad dedicated to 1D. But it's not about 1D right now. Anna decided to change the names of 1D. So it's not about Harry, it's about Hardin. It's a fucking fan fiction story, it's not the reality!ï»¿"
"Hardin isnâ€˜t baded off if Harry, not when it comes to the character - Harry was simply how Anna imagined what Hardin looks like, just like Tessa gets the appearance of Indiana Evensï»¿"
Katie's Lens itâ€™s just a book!! Omg grow upï»¿
MSP XD QUEEN And this book/movie which teach moronic little fangirls like you that abusive relationships are completely fine. That manipulation and emotional abuse are a okay when heâ€™s â€œlike omg suppper doooper hawt uWu!â€ùï»¿
"i can't comprehend how stupid some of you guys are. fanfiction has real-life consequences a lot of people fail to realize. it's not ""just a book"". the media as a whole is extremely toxic and tells young girls/boys/others that they need to â€œfixâ€ù all broken people. it normalizes heterosexuality, abusive relationships, violence, and brainwashes them to settle for what they are given because its â€œlove,â€ù which makes them blind to every problem and warningÂ signs in their relationships. believe it or not, the media has a HUGE impact on people, so for you to say that in itself is obstinate and ignorant.to top that off, this toxic story that romanticizes abuse is about/based off harry. the harry we all know and love. the same harry who was made a sex symbol when he was 16 and thrusted into the limelight. the same harry who had to date much older women because that's the image the media slapped on him. the same bright-eyed harry who was barely even 19 years old,Â barely legal when a grown ass woman wrote a story about him in which he takes advantage of and manipulates a girl in every way possible. the same harry who has done everything in his power to make it obvious he is not heterosexual or a womanizer. the same harry who's slogan and mantra is ""treat people with kindness"". the same harry who still cant escape a fanfiction that was written 5 years ago.  whoever said harry was on board with hardin is factually incorrect. harry's NEVER made a public comment/statement about the series so stop making facts up to justify your opinion. and the people telling me to grow up? take your own advice. i'm sorry i won't stand by and watch some horrible, toxic movie which romanticizes and glamorizes unhealthy relationships. the fact that so many fans, the majority being young girls, who are blind to this scares me.ï»¿"

"What fo you mean ""based off Harry""?ï»¿"
Katie's Lens THANK YOU! I lived through the nightmare of an abusive relationship. Itâ€™s horrible to see people trivialise and romanticise what is in reality something awful. They think that if a guy has a pretty face and a good body then everything awful he does is fine; that if he has some bs Hollywood trope tragic backstory then itâ€™s all excusable. Books/movies like this do much more damage than the fans want to admit.ï»¿
"who said that this was fine. I read the book and their relationship is VERY toxic, i'm pretty sure everyone recognized THAT. like its just a book its either you hate it or like... i get what your trying to say but lets be honest no one is that dumb to get in a relationship like this now byeï»¿"

I understand what youâ€™re trying to say but this is not â€œbasedâ€ù off harry styles at all. I donâ€™t think you understand what a FANfiction isï»¿

For what? Heâ€™s not even mentioned in the movie. Every book is inspired by someone or something. The plot for this book/movie had nothing to do with Harry styles besides the main character looking like him. You guys need some common sense to differ from the character and the actual person.ï»¿

I liked harry more as Hardin or â€_Harryâ€œ because I did read the book with Harry and I always imagined Harry as the character hahaï»¿
After movie #NOW avaiIabIe here: t.co/1PTreWhnBuï»¿
@sumaya .12 yea but the media is automatically gonna link harry to the book simply for the fact that it was a harry styles fanficï»¿
@Sydney_E exactlyï»¿
@Kelly - thank fucking godï»¿
"To everyone in the comment section: the book itself had nothing associated to Harry other then the fact that it was a Harry Styles fan fiction. And the only reason why Hardin in the film doesnâ€™t look like your typical bad boy is because the author had decided it would be too cliche which is something I do agree with. And if anyone here feels sorry for Harry, you have to remember that this movie is for entertainment purposes and for those who had been waiting for years for this to happen. This film isnâ€™t suppose to be representing Harry or his looks. Harry is Harry and Hardin is Hardin. And if you donâ€™t want the media to associate this with Harry, stop mentioning Harry when it comes to the After Series.ï»¿"
the movie isnâ€™t even abt him smh _Ÿ___Ÿè_â€çâ™€ï¸èï»¿
"Hannah it isnâ€™t supposed to be him lol. In the published books, the character is Hardin instead of Harry. Sorry if someone already stated that but honestly I freaking LOVVEEE Harry Styles soo I would love if it were him tbhï»¿"
@mel oxs i swear harry is actually gonna end up being associated with this film because of the people complaining and mentioning him and THEN he will actually feel terribleï»¿
I still donâ€™t get y yâ€™all r associating harry styles with the movie. He has NOTHING do with it smhï»¿
"I'm so sick of your thoughts and your fucking comments about Harry. Please stop talking about Harry. Anna was imagining him to talk like that but she never made him as a human being bad. It's a fucking fan fiction book. I can't understand you guys. Get over it and if you think that this movie is going be bullshit or something like this just dont watch the fucking movie. I dont know what are you doing here if you dont like this teaser. Just keep your opinion for yourselves because we dont fucking care. What do you think, that Harry Styles was going to play in the movie as the main character? Your comments make me sickï»¿"
Funny after i read this on wattpad all i can imagine is hero's face not harry so better stop saying its all abt harry.ï»¿
This is so rapeyï»¿
THIS OS HAPPEINGï»¿
OMFGï»¿
Who else knows why she made  that face at 0.54 secsï»¿
"SPOILER (if you didn't read the books)LORD JESUS CHRIST! probably is the part when she finds out that they had made a bet...ï»¿"
What is the name of the song played in this trailer ???ï»¿
@sonal adlakha dangerous woman by ariana grandeï»¿
Thankyou _Ÿ¥°ï»¿
"What a completely horrible representation of relationships for all young teenagers. I am beyond annoyed that this is really happening. Abuse is unacceptable and this story completely normalises and romanticises it. We ask for a change in the industry, better representation and healthy portrayals, yet some continue to encourage and motivate projects such as this where emotional abuse, over protectiveness and manipulation are key players in a young girls obsession with a boy. Something needs to change and everyone affiliated with this piece of fiction needs to reevaluate.ï»¿"
"iammikayla um before you try to slander the book why donâ€™t you read it first? In the books Hardin evolves over time into the man he becomes in the last one. No he isnâ€™t perfect by any means and yes the relationship WAS toxic, But Tessa molded him into the sweet lovable man with kids and is married something that he never imagined himself doing or being the relationship is toxic but we as the readers arenâ€™t looking for a relationship like theirs if anything we can learn from their mistakes Anna worked hard for this book and now itâ€™s becoming a movie and you should be proud not voice your opinion about their relationship and how you donâ€™t think itâ€™s right to turn it into a movie because at the end of the day itâ€™s still a movie and your opinion my opinion and the next persons opinion doesnâ€™t matter so just be happy for them and this movieï»¿"
"iammikayla exactly!I just really dislike this book because of that, because even if itâ€™s fiction, when a 13-year-old teen reads it, they think itâ€™s correct and thatâ€™s how love should be when itâ€™s completely wrong and corrupted. It even gives me chills when I hear even adult women see this as â€œromanticâ€ù. Actually, thanks to this book, my bff got involved with an asshole that treated her bad and always made her feel guilty, he even manipulated her and also me! And worst of all, he was ridiculously jealous, possessive and obsessive (even if itâ€™s been a long time ever since it ended, he still is super obsessed with my friend). And yes, just like the asshole of Hardin, he technically pressured her to have sex with him when he knew she wanted to be a virgin until marriage!I canâ€™t believe my best friend liked this shit. Or that this shot got this famous while I, also a Wattpad writer, barely get readers with a book that portrays a healthy relationship.ï»¿"
Judith Fangirl01 umm... i read this book when i was 11 and i didnt think this relationship was correct at all . Its drama and its entertaining thats why people like plus it was smut and people read  it for that as well _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
everyone loves bad boy lolï»¿
"A Mariahxo maybe you thought that and thatâ€™s good!Nevertheless, not all people react like you as it happened with my best friend...Like if youâ€™re very mature, youâ€™ll know that itâ€™s wrong, but if youâ€™re not mature, the opposite happens. So thatâ€™s why I think that Anna should have been more careful with this types of themes given the audience this is directed to. Just like 13 reasons why did, to put an example, where they stated that suicide is not an answer and that they werenâ€™t intending to glorify it. Anna shouldâ€™ve stated that also; that the book portrayed a toxic relationship that mustnâ€™t be followed in real life or she couldâ€™ve even offered some hotlines to attend those type of cases...ï»¿"
"@Elizabeth Morgan  Uh no? It romanticizes abuse, plain and simple. Why should we advertise something like this? So young women get themselves with abuse men just to try and change them from abusive to kind? To teach young women what? DON'T GET WITH MEN LIKE THIS PLAIN AND SIMPLE. IT SHOULDN'T BE BE ROMANTICIZED IN THE FIRST PLACE. I don't understand how people like you think any of this is okay. Whether not the movie makes this dude nicer, the fact that they decided to make a movie off of what they saw from the original material is gross. Honestly fuck off with your opinions. You can have them but it doesn't mean they aren't vile.ï»¿"
"FileLps yes they romanticize an abusive relationship and itâ€™s comments like yours that make people who thought their relationship was perfect think twice. But honestly itâ€™s about real life here, not everyone has the perfect relationship and everything is okay all the time. So what youâ€™re saying is Tessa should of stayed with Noah even though she didnâ€™t truly love him? She never gave up on Hardin some people do need guidance to strive to be nicer... Hardin would of been alone all his life and probably died at the age of twenty three. No one with half a brain is going to go out and try to find a bad boy with anger issues to try to change them because of a movie or a book if people want to change thatâ€™s entirely up to themselvesï»¿"
So have you forgot about Fifty shades of grey? It romanticized emotional abuse too and look where it got them: to three movies but nobody seems to talk about this. They are so many movies with emotional abuse and you donâ€™t even know how the movie is going to be. Yes it is a book adaptation but movies based on books are different from what is actually written in the book. Have you even seen Hardin emotionally abuse that girl in the teaser? Youâ€˜ve just seen the teaser chill.ï»¿
"well sis, ""life is like a movie"". you dont always get happiness in life. tragedy happens. shit happens and u gotta deal with it. What a person has been plotting with her creative mind is being brought to life. sorry but let's be realistic here cant we?ï»¿"
@DU CI yesssssï»¿
"The book shows change over time, the characters develop into better people. At the end they both split because itâ€™s a toxic relationship but they CHANGE which is key to why they get back together.ï»¿"
You just don't get what this story is about...ï»¿
"iammikayla yes we all know this. Nobody in real life thinks toxic relationships is normal nor do we want them. Itâ€™s a damn story. Yâ€™all take everything so personal. Just like with 50 shades of grey, twilight, etc. everything is abuse this abuse that yet the movies still sell out in a day in theaters? Iâ€™m confused. The people that complain be the main ones watching it in the end. Goofys out here frfr.ï»¿"
"Sae E hhaha uâ€™re right, them haters will ended up finishing the books, watching teaser, full trailer and eventually watch the film with the excused to give their full, right, and negative opinions on After.ï»¿"
"Oh, shut up! Itâ€™s your problem what you take from the books and movies! You know you can learn from their mistakes ( if you insist, Tessaâ€™s) so that you donâ€™t allow someone to bahave like that with you. I think itâ€™s up to us.ï»¿"
"what are you talking about first READ the book before you say anything about abuse !!fucking bitchï»¿"
Abuse?! are you fucking kidding me? Did you even read the book? He never touched her. So shut up!!ï»¿
"For all the idiots saying he didn't touch her in a ""bad way"", and therefore it was not abuse, you really should learn what is mental fucking abuse. You imbecilesï»¿"
"Spoiler alert!!! Women need to learn to love and respect themselves. We do not need this shit of normalizing and, what it's worst, ROMANTIZISING abusive relationships. I cannot talk about the movie because I haven't seen it obviously, but everyone who has read the book should (or I hope so) agree that this is not a healthy relationship. This was not love. If you think it was, then you need to talk to somebody like fr.  And it teaches young women the idea that he loved her, but he ""didn't know how to love because he was never loved"". ""Poor baby"". Let me vomit. And yes, they end up together, married and with kids, so what. That really does not prove anything???!!!!. What is wrong with you people. Seriously, you need to inform yourselves about mental abusive relationships.ï»¿"
"I see you, but actually Anna did say that in an interview I think or somewhere else. She said that YES this relationship is toxic and NO abuse is not okay. She did say that. @Judith Fangirl01ï»¿"
"phallyka oung exactly like donâ€™t fucking watch if youâ€™re going to complain Theyâ€™re Annoying asfï»¿"
"he slowly becomes a better person throughout the relationship n in case u uncultured swines dont know, there is a thing called character development so donâ€™t come at me or the author until youâ€™ve read the whole series n is very open-minded about the story_Ÿ–•_Ÿè_ï»¿"
"its a MOVIE shut up and if u want to see something real go outside jesus yall getting on my nerves, its fiction like every other movie on the planet stop being offended by everything, weâ€™ve seen worse tbh lmfaoï»¿"
@Cristina Romero Alfaro completely agree with you. It just teach girls in a toxic relationship that it will somehow become real love but we all know what happens in real life in this relationships.ï»¿

@kamcum 07 Can I ask how it's toxic? I didn't finish it _Ÿ˜…ï»¿
kamcum 07 them being young doesnâ€™t excuse the fact that theyâ€™re toxic af..ï»¿
Kylie read the whole series to understandï»¿
Stalking* Funtime true that but Hardin had a fucked up childhood which made him into the Asshole he is. I canâ€™t deny that the way he hurt Tessa was toxic af. But u see the thing is the book shows how assholes actually act irl unlike some other clichÃ¨ romance novels. It also shows that people as fucked up as Hardin can change if u nvr give up on themï»¿
"kamcum 07 I just feel like this movie is only going to have a brief conversation about his childhood and then sheâ€™ll just instantly forgive him. Everyone talks about how in the books there is development and he changes, but this is a movie.. I doubt itâ€™ll go in depth. Looking at the trailer itâ€™s going to sell itself as your typical sexy/romance genreï»¿"

But we just can't avoid the fact that they are really immatures and bad for each other in that moment of their lives, people who talk about their toxic relationship is totally right in my opinion.

"@Dania a i really can't tell you details because i read it at least 5 years ago or more and wanted to forget it, it wasn't just a poor book but also the story sucks and it's basically sex and fights and he is very toxic, controling and a bunch of bad stuff and she is an idiot and keeps sticking around despite all the crap he does and how he treats her and there's like the big plot twist at the end that's an effed up thing he does and we are like supposed to think it's forgivable and they can work on a relationship when literally nothing about it is good or healthy and it started badly from the go and for the wrong reasons, i don't wanna spoil you but he's thrash and she is an idiot basically and he doesn't get called out on his crap, or at least doesn't really get any backlash or real consecuences from the things he does. I don't think he actually punches her in it, i think it would have gotten a bigger uproar, he does break things and get physically violent i think but idk if towards her body, but he is constantly humiliating her, taking advantage, being verbally and emotionally abusive and controling her. I don't recall her being like that, it's mostly him being the worst kind of ""bad boy"" to her and it's not even a fun book to read, i recommend it for torture lol, i've read some bad YA books that i barely endured but this was top notch really. I don't even recommend it unless you're brave for an ironic reading because it had like 100 chapters, literally. I don't know how much better the published version can be because basically it is his personality and what the plot revolves around as little as there is needs him to do that stuff or nothing would happen so yeah, it's not relationship goals and he doesn't show signs of wanting to change or being really sorry for being scum and young teens are all about wanting a guy like him and i fear for this book becoming famous with this new generation, it's raunchy and violent and exhausting and there's no lesson taught or self awareness of what's wrong inside it so... It's a no from me haha. Sorry for the speech, being precise, i've never heard of her.  And i know some fangirls might try to come for me so jic don't even start, i won't change my mind about this turd story and maybe when you grow older or learn what true love or a healthy relationship is you'll know better, this ain't it sis, sorryï»¿"
It so happens that I like fighting and sexï»¿

@Sol AdriÃ¡n girl you're right!!ï»¿

@FileLps i stated ntn abt that. Just saying most love the trilogyï»¿
Me tooï»¿
FileLps Have you actually ever read it? Jesus. That has nothing to do with it. In relationships itâ€™s normal to have fights. He had a rough past so they thought that he didnâ€™t deserve her so he pushed her away.ï»¿
FileLps if you had a brain youâ€™d know that the author talks about how the story has nothing to do with that.ï»¿

Yeeessss read the books before the movie will get popular hahaï»¿
@Maura Sanchez It's okay if you don't like it but stop beeing rude and stop saying it's bullshit. If it really was that bad it wouldn't be a worldwide bestseller and there wouldn't be such a big big fanbase. If you don't like it then just stay quiet and don't watch it. Why would you waste your time watching the trailer (and helping it gain views) and commenting about it?ï»¿
@FileLps omg first of all its not a trilogy there are way more books. Second of all it just shows how complicated and hard relationships and love can be. Not everyone's life is super simple and super easy. And third of all if it would really be THAT BAD I wouldn't have such a big big fanbase all around the worldand it definitely it would not become a movie. If you don't like it then just don't watch it. You won't change people's minds by saying it that you find it abusive. Why would you waste your time watching the trailer (and helping it gain views) and commenting about it?ï»¿
@Meghan Gracie thank you!ï»¿

But Wattpad already insured that _Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
"@Ines Sophie Because I was curious? I've read most of the story to see why people hated it so much. And the ""if you don't like it, don't watch it"" is such a problematic way of thinking. Jesus Christ are you all abuse excusers? The entire story was emotionally and mentally abusive. Why in the world would you want to support anything to do with that. This is disgusting. I don't care how big of a fanbase the series has. That doesn't mean anything. fifty shades of grey has a big fanbase but that doesn't mean what was going on between them wasn't toxic and manipulative as well. But that's okay for you right? To let this type of media get promoted or excused because it fulfilled your 13 year old fantasy of being able to change the bad boy into a good guy? Like it said before,, that's vile.ï»¿"

more like a kidz bop version of 50 shades..ï»¿
@marya haque I agree _Ÿ‘çâ˜ºï¸èï»¿
glorification of toxic relationships other fanfics deserved a movie not this oneï»¿
glorification of toxic relationships is heterosexual culture :( sadï»¿
"Yup, I agreeAnd not only straights have toxic relationships in fanfiction; also in many fanfics and manga that have yaoi (boyxboy) or Yuri (girlxgirl) have also super toxic relationships that, sadly, are glorified. Examples could be: Killing Stalking, Citrus, A Guy Like You, What Does The Fox Say (yes, like the song lol), among othersï»¿"
"i mean ... itâ€™s real life things like this happen and peoole seem to like it,  thats why it got 476 million readsï»¿"
"Yeah, and I have nothing against people reading this, but if you think of an immature person reading this, that personâ€™s going to think is good, when it actually isnâ€™t. Yes, toxic relationships are a real thing that happen every day, but whatâ€™s wrong here is the fact that this book and movie glorifies it, when it should portray it as something bad insteadï»¿"
"A Mariahxo Yeah, it does happen in real life, but guess what, it ends up in femicide not in some ""hot"" hate-fucking session.  this kind of shit normalizes this mindset. And it's literally just about teenagers fucking, like, hello? At least the 50 shades shit was about adult people, but like, we're talking about kids, teens who are easily influenced by media, and i'm not saying they're stupid, i'm saying that that's a vulnerable age. this shit is gross. You're not supposed to like it when boys treat you like shit. And i get that this is fan fiction or whatever, and i get that people get off on this kind of shit or worse kind of shits, but don't act like it's okay just bc it was liked and glorified by a big number of weirdos.And honestly, fanfiction can be good and original and safe, and there are tons of it that could do better than this joke of a film. this shit seems unoriginal and clichÃ© and fucking gross and fucked up, and it doesn't surprise me lmao. I hope it flops and all the freaks who like it are losers, god bless âœŒxxï»¿"

"So fucking true tho. I've read the books when I was younger and I ""loved"" him because I thought he was only a poor boy with issues. But he was mentally abusive towards Tessa, and that, I didn't see it. Maybe the movie is more appropiate, but the books are fucking trashï»¿"

"@Antonia Cordova LITERALLY. They flirtied,then Hardin denied they had something going on, then they would fight, then hardin would apologize and Tessa would be like ,,welp, he said sorry, i guess i gotta fuck him,,ï»¿"
"Antonia Cordova Did you read all 3 books? How does the story end? Whatâ€™s the plot twist? Since you clearly know so much about after. Iâ€™ve read all the fan fictions to after and thatâ€™s not all that happens. Yes they fight, and yes they have sex but thatâ€™s not all that happens.ï»¿"
"Meghan Gracie look you can like whatever you want, chill, but it doesnt mean it isnt of a very questionable quality this thing right here, it could be a guilty pleasure of yours or idk, but you cant deny that it is problematic, and it literally doesnt matter to me if it has a big plotwist at the end of the 4 books, that justify all of hardins mean ways and idiotic actions of tessa, and honestly i wouldnt know, because i got bored over the same repeated shit, after the I believe 2nd book? So yeah, maybe it gets better, idk, but i do recall all of the problems it had the first one. Iâ€™m not gonna see the movie, but i hope they change things in this for the better_Ÿ_·_Ÿè_â€çâ™€ï¸èï»¿"
"Antonia Cordova you shouldnâ€™t judge it unless youâ€™ve actually read all of it. In the last book he changes completely. A plot twist is that he was writing a book about her and their love story, and published it and became famous. It flashed a few years into the future. Tessa and him have completely broken up, but then they meet at Liamâ€™s wedding (which we donâ€™t know who he married) you donâ€™t know how much he grow and changed as a person, he got over his issues and actually matured. At the end of the book they left the wedding engaged. Donâ€™t judge unless youâ€™ve read it. Iâ€™m not good at explaining things.ï»¿"
"Meghan Gracie it still is a no from me, but ok then, if this sort of things make you happy thats good, iâ€™m just gonna pass because i cant overlook all of the problems in, well, all of the topics this book touches_Ÿ˜…, and iâ€™d rather use my time to read other types of books you know?ï»¿"
@Meghan Gracie thank you. Finally someone with a brainï»¿
@Meghan Gracie omg I'm glad that people like you are here to talk to these peopleï»¿
"Antonia Cordova I get your point, but itâ€™s actually really good and itâ€™s very realistic. I mean, no one is perfect and Hardin is the definition of that. He thinks Tessa is perfect and that she deserves better than him; which is true she does. But he grows. At the beginning he didnâ€™t care about school, he didnâ€™t want to graduate, he hated his dad, and he thought he was an only child. Imagine going through all that stuff and growing up with no one caring about you unless they want something. Later on in the story he actually graduated from college, he becomes best friends with Liam even though he hated him. He forgives his birth father for abandoning him, and he forgives his other father for being abusive. He changes completely, he is now an amazing person. You probably donâ€™t know this because maybe you havenâ€™t been through this certain thing. But, when youâ€™re so hated on and feel like you canâ€™t be loved you much that ones that really love you away. He has never physically abuse Tessa, ever. He has only yelled at her, which he regrets. At one point Tessa actually leaves him for good, but they get together at the end because they realize how theyâ€™re meant for each other and that they could never love anyone else like they loved each other. No better how toxic the relationship is, you should never leave each other if there is a way to fix the person that is broken.ï»¿"
@Evelyn Huerta yep and is basically sex and a lot of fightsï»¿
@Meghan Gracie well said _Ÿ‘è_Ÿ‘èï»¿
"The book is basically sex, fight, sex, fight, sex, break up, sex, sex, sex. And in between a bit storyline about their life together. And in the end he changes an they get married. It was really difficult to read all of it, but overall I'm glad I did. Even if it's a clichÃ© wattpad storyï»¿"
"to all the girls that are commenting: fuck off. you guys really need to know about love in teenagers. what did you want? the perfect boy who has to treat you like a princess? the boy who never can get mad? i mean seriously, let's be more realistic. we all were teens and we all had this toxic relationship and guess what? we all already  know it is toxic! but c'mon they were teens and they didn't really know what they were doing. read all the books and THEN you can talk, because you'll see the progress. Hardin became into a good man and Tessa learnt about self love. byeï»¿"
"@Antonia Cordova exactly, imagine how toxic that is lol... hope the movie is not like thatï»¿"
Antonia Cordova on the second book he basically begs to tessa to come back..... after a while(not a lot) she finally agrees.........againï»¿
