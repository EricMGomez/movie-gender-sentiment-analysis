"1:32 - 1:53I like they are adding a story,  makes the contracts and potential ramifications interesting. Love the concept of Agent 47 used as a killing tool, but he does barely know what ultimately for. Sure he get's briefings and most targets are morally on the evil side, however there is no "" grand plan "" that 47 or the other agents know of. Only the handlers and ICA do. Love that idea.ï»¿"
now if only hitman 2 had cutscenes...ï»¿

"I love how in 0:45 the waves in the water shows that 47 entered in the pool, but we never see him; we are seeing what the target is perceiving until he feels that something is odd, then we see 47's hand killing him in a matter of seconds, cause that's the only thing the target managed to see before dying.ï»¿"

The  song name is Niels Bye Nielsen â€” Legacy (Hitman OST)ï»¿
name of the soundtrack please?ï»¿
WOW maybe the best trailer I have seenï»¿
I really preferred absolution more than the new HITMAN. Way more story was involved. HITMAN doesn't make sense and the story is boring afï»¿
Scorpio i guess you didnt play blood moneyï»¿
"I did! It was great! But then we got introduced to absolution, and it was phenomenal. Its funny because i hated it at the start because it wasn't sandbox like missions bar the gun ranch mission. But i was completely captivated by the story. Maybe they should have a mix! for the next game... after season 2. Half- sandbox and half walk-through missions! A great captivating yet simplistic story is essential. HITMAN is like a puzzle to follow story wise... There's just no comparison between the two games. Absolution is way better!ï»¿"
+Scorpio No just...No...Hitman is not for you.ï»¿
I don't think Liam Neeson can get his family back from 47...ï»¿
Oh yes he can.ï»¿
CaptainNightvale neither I think.ï»¿
"Just noticed something, the guy talking at around 1:07 is the guy we see pointing a sniper at Agent 47 after the Japan mission in the cutscene. He's the shadow client.ï»¿"
Just to clarify... is this trailer for the new Hitman game?ï»¿

"Given that the scenes in this trailer follow the chronological order in which they appear in the series, it is only logical to assume that the final scene with Diana Burnwood at the airport will feature in the latest Hitman game. Perhaps not even Agent 47's handler will have a happy ending.ï»¿"

"Let me start with thisI am a huge Hitman fan. I played and beat every major hitman game  and I am no marksman, but...Why during the casino sniper shot he shoots when the Casino sign is OFF??? It gives away the flash!Maybe its a coincidence, but if not thats a bad move on Mr 47's endï»¿"
Will the $60 Hitman have an actual story? Or will it just be a little mini game sorta thing like Rainbow Six: Siegeï»¿

is that liam neeson at 2:10?ï»¿
47 looks older at the end of the trailer I'm confused as to whether this is a prequel or sequelï»¿
"the game starts as a prequel with 47 training for the ica, then this cutscene plays. after that the game is a sequel to absolutionï»¿"

wait SEASON premieres? WTF so is this gonna be like Life is Strange to where you have to buy them separately  and can't get the full game when it comes out?!ï»¿
@bergenheisâ€‹ Got any ideas on how many episodes there is? also why can't they just drop the full game itself just like how the old Hitman games were to where when you buy a game day one you can expect the FULL GAME in your hands.ï»¿
@bergenheisâ€‹ that's exactly why I'm pissed i gotta wait atleast a year to play it like WTF!!! Is this a new way of devs making more money off us?ï»¿
@bergenheisâ€‹ well you said if i want the 'full' game on hands then i gotta wait later this year not even dude cause remember Life is Strange the game came out January 2015 the limited edition came out a year after which was January 2016 and it includes all 5 episodesï»¿
I WOULD have been excited but I'm not buying this game until it's bundled as one full game.ï»¿

"textures and graphics look good, animations are a bit roboticï»¿"
"If only they spent as much time on the game itself as they did on this trailer, then it would be great. What with shady episodic content released monthly and not much improvement/innovation in terms of gamepIay and graphics I have seen in the beta, I am really skeptical of this release of hitman. Will wait till the full games comes out with reviews.ï»¿"
Beautiful trailer but I'm still waiting for the physical copy at the end of 2016.ï»¿
But could agent 47 have done it against the 95-96 Chicago Bulls?ï»¿

This game might be something else once getting into the story line.ï»¿

@***ORIGINAL*** TheRealGamer!â„¢ Lol well since you said 0:13 is from hitman 3 contracts but it's originally from codename 47 poor choice of words right thereï»¿
"@TheKrejzibejbi In Codename, you are supposed to take an elevator to three different spots you can choose and assassinate the guy. In Contracts, you just run up the stairs to a building nearby, and wait for the targets to arrive, also in Contracts the targets take a walk around the area, and in the Legacy Cinematic, you can see 47 moving the sniper scope slightly.ï»¿"
"@Alexander Langfeldt No. There are four missions where your target is too powerful to kill, because he has many allies. His gangster is supposed to meet with another gang. You have to snipe the target's gangster, and then in the other mission, you are supposed to finish the job and kill the other's gang's gangster after he met up with the target. After that there is a meeting set up to settle their differences, and you must disguise yourself as the target's messanger, show yourself in the meeting, and then kill the other messangers. The next mission is taking down the target himself. Of all these missions, the one where you snipe the target's gangster is the one in the trailer.ï»¿"

@***ORIGINAL*** TheRealGamer!â„¢ Ohhh! I played the pirated version and it had no cutscenes in between missions. I thought I was just playing Hitman 1 with better graphics.ï»¿
You forgot about the mission with 47 snipering the Shieq on top of the Shamal hotel which is shown at the beginning of the trailerï»¿

"Hello, Agent 47 is part of a clone program thats why his number is 47. It was the 47 child of that program. Was born on September 5, 1964, in a Romania (East Europe Contry) in a secret asylum. The main father is Dr. Ort-Meyer also the head of the project. It is know that he was cloned after a mix of combination of DNA's, 5 to be more exactly thats why he has 5 fathers. Ort-Meyer was desperated to created the perfect human.The program was sponoserd by the government to create the ultimate soldiers/espionage agents. He escaped during the Romanian Revolution in 1989 when the president was killed and the communist government fall. In early 1998 has joined ICA (International Contract Agency). Hope this helps you.ï»¿"
