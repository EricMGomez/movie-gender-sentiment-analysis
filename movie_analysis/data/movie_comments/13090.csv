i want these two in another movie together again.ï»¿
"It's such a good movie, I deeply enjoy it!ï»¿"
"I don't get it. Why do Brits like Emily and Keira Knightley (in ""The Jacket"") play Americans movies like these? They don't do a great job hiding their English accents. Aussies Anna Torv and Jacqueline McKenzie wipe the floor with them in that area! Kinda funny that Keira's fellow Brit Daniel Craig was also in the ""The Jacket""...ï»¿"
"This movie rocks. The trailer has not done justice to this movie. Guys, watch this movie and you will love it.ï»¿"
The movie is better than the trailer.ï»¿
This is such a beautiful movie! Highly Recommendedï»¿
Don't wait for perfect daysï»¿
Love this movie!ï»¿
I love movies like this. They did an excellent job making this movie.ï»¿
Great Movie which will make you cry for sure....Amy Adams as usual best in acting...ï»¿
"Your so right i just watched and was tearing up, the scene when her sister fell on that mattress was hilariousï»¿"
"I would highly recommend this movie. It's real and true to life. However, it's NOT meant as a comedy so don't start watching it think it is. It's a really good movie. They have it on YouTube with no catches so you can watch it.ï»¿"
good movie. is Emily james blunt's sister or did I just toke a bluntï»¿
"@dONALD BloodÂ No. He meant ""toke"", as in, taking a toke, or I took a toke of my joint, or in this case blunt.ï»¿"
CRANE WIFE.ï»¿
ssssssssssssshhhttttï»¿
Gail the Snailï»¿
"100% correct.  Whatever character they play, they put on an unbelievable performance.  Get these two in more movies together.ï»¿"
Not even close.ï»¿
Is this a chick flick?ï»¿
"The trailer doesn't really do the film justice. The trailer makes it look like a typical indie comedy, when the feel has so much serious depth to it that this trailer does not show.ï»¿"
He knows that lobster man is out there...and he's totally screwed. Lolï»¿
Love amy adams and emily blunt in this.  3ï»¿
"business lie, not the same as a life lie. :) great movieï»¿"

"We love this story! we got to do a scene from this in our acting class and it was great fun-awesome movie!:)ï»¿"
Emily Blunt's American accent is great.ï»¿

"@YoungRapperWL97, well you wouldn't know unless you saw, now would you?ï»¿"
"lmaooo this was a sickkk film.. Proper weirdd and stuff !!ï»¿"
Seriously though I loved itï»¿
"This is just a great movie, it's fantastic and wonderful, and I dran a bottle of champagne while watching it just now, whch made it even so much betterï»¿"
Such a great filmï»¿
"fun funny humanistic movie .. the girls are realistic as is the father .. alan is his usual near nutter but very cool and sharp self.. the kid is right on. and stubby is cool too... and this flick offers more than just a story.. to learn what.. watch it... very worth itï»¿"
i really liked the movie. thats why im disappointed that we dont see emily blunt enough in this trailer ! shes wonderfulï»¿
"WOOH! THERE'S MY BABY! A Toyota Trecel Wagon. Haven't seen this movie but I'm guessing by the car being featured in ever exterior shot, (and driving around 1:01) she drives it. You can see a red one in Breaking Bad driven by Jesse Pinkman. Mine was green. Yay!ï»¿"
emily blunt is so gorgeous <3ï»¿
@Dina80622 ouch... if you dont like the movie dont make a fucking rude ass commentï»¿

"HORRIBLE MOVIE , so disapointing. Emily Blunt should stop acting. Horrible actress. God. What a stupid movie.ï»¿"
Awesome movie. I really like Emily's character and highly recommend everyone to watch this film.ï»¿
"Loved that last scene! This was a great movie, I loved it. It's so real and touching. Not to mention has some humour which is always nice :)But yeah, this is a great movie, go watch it if you havn't! ï»¿"
@Riddierid It isn't. It's a great movie. Very real. I'd recommend you watch it. ï»¿

ahahahaha when she falls on the mattress is a pant wetterï»¿
"why would ppl not like this, its good :)ï»¿"
@SaraTorjman The Crane Wife 3 by The Decemberistsï»¿
What a fantastic cast - Zahn and Arkin - are you kiddin' me?!ï»¿
This takes place in my hometown. It's good to finally get some recognition. I watched this movie last night lol its hilarious.ï»¿
"Amazing film... Indie films are always the best, they're so meaningful and makes the audience thinkï»¿"

"@MusicRmyLife The Crane Wife 3 by the Decembristsï»¿"
amy adams is great in everyway! love her ! ^_^ï»¿
"just watch'd the movie...its a nice one! and good cast!! both girls were just so perfect !! ï»¿"
"If a movie's great, it's worthy of seeing in a cinema.  If it's decent, it's a rental.  If it's...  meh.... so so... it's a download.   ;)  Speaking of which- lol.  :) ï»¿"
"i really liked this movie! Emily Blunt did a great job, same with Amy Adams... heck, the entire cast was brilliant!ï»¿"
I never knew a sentence about pie could make me cry ï»¿
"I rented this movie, it was actually pretty good,i was sad when i had to return it. :(ï»¿"
Emily Blunt is an English ? Wow she can speak American accent pretty well :) She is amazing and lovely including Amy Adams.ï»¿
Lobster man - hilarious!ï»¿
Lobster man - hilarious!ï»¿
at some parts i did almost throw up haahahï»¿
"Yes, I'm on the east coast now but was there many years. They really hit the nail on the head though in capturing the place. Most people watching the movie  would not know it from any other ""American"" type city.  But there are many dead give-aways that the locals would know about.ï»¿"
"The screenplay background and character development was amazingly accurate when it comes to setting the movie in Albuquerque, capturing the atmosphere of the town and people perfectly. It is indeed a wide open quirky kind of a place, that can be rather unlovely, with a lot of low income housing, but can also be stunning in it's stark desert beauty, and as a new area enclave for the artistic and well-to-do.  Arkin's character as an old NY type salesman moved West, is typical of many there now.ï»¿"
I love thatscene with herunder the train tracks with her hands out whil the the train goes. Makes me feel happy :)ï»¿
this is a cute movie!ï»¿
"It was really really similar to Little Miss Sunshine, but thats ok cause its my favorite movieï»¿"
"I want to see this so bad, two of my favorites actress together I can't wait!!!!!!!!!!ï»¿"
"Fair enough. I never saw the movie, and I think it would take months for blood to turn as black as it looks in this clip. But almost every square inch in our house after Katrina was covered in that black mold, so it's pretty easy for me to spot, last time I checked. But anyway, I'll watch this film some other time. Peaceï»¿"
"thats blood from the suicide they were talking about in the trailer, mold doesn't grow on florescent lights fixtures last time I checked lolï»¿"
Check out all the toxic black mold on the ceiling panels in the sporting goods store at 0:49ï»¿
The ending scene is the best. Lmfao! XPï»¿
Emily Blunt is a good actress. Love her.ï»¿
â™¥â™¥â™¥ï»¿
The song at the end is The Crane Wife 3 by The Decemberistsï»¿

"GREAT MOVIE.  My favorite line ""Why don't you just say your mormon?""   lolï»¿"
God damnit there isn't so much drama in life!!!!ï»¿
So do we get to see any tits or what?ï»¿

Love this movie. It's awesome.ï»¿
Jeez...its a business lie not like a life lie...lolï»¿
its an amazing movieï»¿
"Fail.  It goes; ""It's a lie."" ""Yeah but it's a business lie. It's not the same as a life lie.""ï»¿"
"it's a lieyeah, but it's a business lieit's not a fly lieï»¿"
they don't do anything with the bodies. they come in after everything is done with the crime scene. Nothing really gruesome in it. Very good movie.ï»¿
"Emily Blunt's american accent sounds great. I want to see this, but is it gruesome (like, do they show the bodies and crime scenes they clean up?)?ï»¿"
Totally gud n blutzï»¿
LMAO at the end :)ï»¿
"""it's a lie""""it's a buissness lie""ï»¿"
"funny! i wanna see it! 1:19 looolï»¿"

"I loved Little Miss Sunshine, so really really want to see this.ï»¿"

"Oh, I wanna watch this!! I wonder if this will be in cinemas in Poland or at least available on DVD...ï»¿"
I agree. Best movie of the year. No great scenario but great actors.ï»¿
"I hate little miss sunshine, but this looks goodï»¿"
Emily Blunt is so damn cool :D :) <3ï»¿
It would be such a great TV show!!!!ï»¿
"I just saw this movie. It is really, really good. Want to see it again/own it.ï»¿"
"Emily Blunt and Amy Adams in a movie together.MUST WATCH! :]they're so cool.ï»¿"

"The Jane Austen Book Club that was a good movie but I don't think in came out in theatres Charlie Wilson's War, The Simpsons, and Dan in Real Lifeï»¿"
