I lost brain cells watching this BUT some seem to like it.ï»¿
Worst friends everrrrrrï»¿
"This movie should have been called Three Nasty Ass Sluts.What a peice of junk!Lizzy Caplan is so annoying!!ï»¿"
I give this movoe 4 stars. The girls were shitty friends. But it was funny. I wish they had a warning or something about when the girl tried to kill herself..ï»¿
"This movie is HILARIOUS!!!! It's a must watch trust me, it's even better than the trailerï»¿"
"I can't imagine a movie getting any lower than this one. What was Kirsten Dunst thinking??  Unfunny, tries way too hard, and flops. The dumpster-stench of film, but worse than that unforgettable smell of  rotting tumors from a dying cancer patient.ï»¿"
"IMO The girls in this movie were horrible. All the comments about it being relatable are blowing my mind. Like, if you have ""friends"" like this for your wedding, I really feel bad for you. I watched it because of Rebel, and I wanted to punch Kirsten the entire time. Haha it was a good movie, just shitty ass characters in it.ï»¿"
"Dang, treated the fat gurl like crap and got away with all of it. Smh this movie and crap and I those type if females could NOT be my friend.ï»¿"
Shitty movie. It wasnt even funny. More like jealous of the bride. If i have friends like that i kick them to the curve.ï»¿
"This movie was HILARIOUS I realllly didnâ€™t expect it to be worth watching a second time. Kirsten Dunst shines in this one, she is brutal and so funny. Well doneï»¿"
"I think this was such a rediculous movie. Not even funny. Only immature audiences, will like this. Not for anyone over 40, for sure.  TRUST ME!!ï»¿"
Iâ€™m 30 and thought it was ridiculous and a waste of time to watch.ï»¿
I seriously cried of laughter when they all made references about 'My so called life'!!!ï»¿
I was absolutely in hysterics at moments but what 'best friends' no matter how high/drunk you are think it's a good idea to try the wedding dress on and while making mean comments on her size; this dress can fit 2 people...ï»¿
"This movie was hilarious! I did laugh my ass off and enjoyed it. I can see how it can be relatable but in a really sad 'more raw' honest way to some compared to 'Bridesmaids'.... Lol I just felt like that would be such a shitty friendship to be in, you know??ï»¿"
Was real fun to watch BUT at the end it suddenly dawned on me that the only people of color in the ENTIRE FILM where the black cleaning lady and the asian utility woman. NO HEROINE was of ANY other than WHITE> OMFG!!!!!! Did this slip out of peoples minds for a film being made at 2012?!?!?!ï»¿
"A LOT of romantic comedies seem to be that way. MOST of them, actually.ï»¿"
Kirsten Dunst looks like the oldest person in this group but she's actually one of the youngest.ï»¿
This movie fulfills all the requirements for a total white trash movie.ï»¿
This is a pretty good movie i would recommendï»¿
It would've been even cooler if they got Bryce Dallas Howard & Eliza Dushku (Kirsten's co-stars from Spiderman 3 & Bring It) to be in the Movie. Big Reunion !!!ï»¿
You spell Caplan wrongï»¿
okay so I'm glad I watched this movie before watching the trailer because I actually liked this movie but the trailer looked shitty.ï»¿
"Loved this movie but still cant find that song it plays at the end credits and in the background when they leave the bridal shop.....anyone know it?ï»¿"
check movie credits it has to be there if it's the last song it'll be the last credited song.ï»¿
"I remember this movie, it was good. But with friends like that, who needs enemies.ï»¿"
smithredhawk SERIOUSLY!! Just discovered this movie today. Don't get me wrong it was funny and I liked the actresses and all but the whole time I was thinking that!!! I personally wouldn't keep those type of friends in my circle... It was funny though!ï»¿
"So I really wanted to say that I really like this movie. And if you happen to come across this trailer and need an opinion on whether or not to watch it, then my answer is yes. Watch it, you won't regret it, there were a few parts where I had to pause the movie so I could laugh my ass off.ï»¿"
Isla Fisher was hilarious in this movieï»¿
This was honestly SO  funny because unlike most comedies it was realistic with relatable characters.ï»¿
It's a good movieï»¿
THAT GIRL IS FROM MEAN GIRLSï»¿
jannet !Â ï»¿
"No, Lindsey Lohan was in it, not Isla Fisherï»¿"
"@Kaitlin Ocampo I think she meant Lizzy Caplin, who was in Mean Girls. She played Janis Ian.ï»¿"
She's my cousinï»¿
is rebel wilson trying to be funny there or itÂ´s watchable?ï»¿
she's trying to be seriousï»¿
This movie is so awesome!! I saw it today!!ï»¿
never ever gonna see this ... shitï»¿
"Â Waste of time....No me parecio para nada graciosa. Demasiados detalles vulgares, y aunque cada quien hace de su vida lo que le gusta, me parecio Â una inncesaria promocion a las drogas... pateticos los personajes de las 3 protagonistas... nada graciosaï»¿"
ummmmmmmmmmmmm why do they focus on the other girls more than rebel! dang it im so happy she has the show s uper fun night now cuz darn it!ï»¿
"So I watched Bridesmaids.. after watching this ..And I stopped at 1.19.10 and wondered..Thought Kristen Dunst would be here.. and here I amï»¿"
ILOVETHIS MOVIEï»¿
they do so much cocaine lolï»¿
"I think this movie is way underrated. The script was pretty good, brilliant actress and an excelent mix of deep drama and comedy. It's not some kind of remake of Bridemais, is an original and verey surprising movie. ï»¿"
"So basically, it's about three skinny single losers that are depressed because their fat friend is successful and they aren't, and at the end of the movie, they all find success in themselves and with men.  Sounds super.ï»¿"
"Alyssa Dominic Totally tho lol, the fact that they were all upset rather than happy for their long time friend was messed up! Lol like y'all girls hating on your best friend since high school and making comments about how she's the first to get married and to a ""really attractive"" guy none the less.... Maybe it's cause she's beautiful inside and out and kind hearted....ï»¿"
"Sounds shitty, thanks for the reinforcement. Won't be watching or buying this oneï»¿"
"LIZZY, MEAN GIRLS, SO PRETTY NOW OMGï»¿"
"Regardless, she's awesome!!!! :Dï»¿"
"It's Lizzy Caplan not ""Caplin"".ï»¿"
Im so happy i watched the movie before the trailer! ï»¿
Women Version of The Hangoverï»¿
i love rebel wilson <3 ï»¿
what's the song called starting at 0:24ï»¿
Kirsten* Dunstï»¿
wow fat amy is getting marriedï»¿
Hangover 4ï»¿
Mostly here for Beth Hoyt.ï»¿
I don't care what anyone says this movie was like 100% better then bridesmaids...ï»¿
This was pretty good.. not as good as bridesmaids tho. Obviously a knock off.ï»¿
like the female version of the hangover ï»¿
"Mj ;) ï»¿"
whats is the name of the song  0.24 sï»¿
it was nice ï»¿
Fat Amy :)ï»¿
Ive seen this movie and it is brilliant ive watched it so many times its unbelievableï»¿
I thought this movie would be boring but it's actually funny as hell!!!!! One of the best comedies Ive seen in a while.ï»¿
And Rebel.ï»¿
All i keep seeing is janis from mean girls... ï»¿
I just realized that's Janis Ian!!!!!!!!!! I love Isla Fisher!!!ï»¿
I honestly liked this more than bridesmaids! ï»¿
Kristen Dust is beautiful!  Funny movie!ï»¿
The movie seemed to b bout the bridesmaids and like the bride wasnt even important. They didn't even really seem to be best friends with the bride.  Waste of timeï»¿
they should do another bachelorette movie because this one was fuckinh hilarious ï»¿
kristen dunst??ï»¿
I really liked this movie.ï»¿
"it's not the typical girl crazy movie, it was surprisingly funny and insightful. two thumbs up yoï»¿"
love this movie!ï»¿
what is the name of the second song in this traile?? (needs and answer) :) Rebel Wilson <3ï»¿
I looovvvve this movieï»¿
HER NAME IS KIRSTEN DUNST! OH MY GOD I AM DYING!ï»¿
Kristen Dunst is the ugliest member of this cast...and that's saying somethingï»¿
Its on netflixï»¿
best cast ever.ï»¿
"im fatï»¿"
megashare.info ï»¿
Where can i download this movie. Not available on isohunt!!!ï»¿
"What? Isla Fisher is the one with red/dark orange-y brown hair, Rebel Wilson is the short blonde one.ï»¿"
Lol. Her name is Isla Fisher. Not some fictional character from a sitcom!ï»¿
U can watch this movie on Netflix its a good movie n funny af.ï»¿
IÂ´m so gonna watch this because of Rebel. SheÂ´s awesome.ï»¿
janis ian????ï»¿
I just saw it. I loved it.ï»¿
So very true.ï»¿
"They are the worse ""friends"" everï»¿"
IS THAT JANET IAN?!?!ï»¿
"Can't let a movie about drunken women who never moved on from their high school ideals get you down, right? Otherwise the larger portion of modern civilization would be depressed because of their inability live and let die. :) ï»¿"
I love that that is all you took from this. Plus: AGREED.ï»¿
I'm pretty sure we can all agree that James Marsden is BEAUTIFUL.ï»¿
Rebel!ï»¿
It's Janis!ï»¿
no...no. just stop. SWERVEï»¿
This looks like the single worst thing ever. FUCK.ï»¿
"No, Fat Patricia!! :D :Dï»¿"
"Kirsten Dunst should play this kind of role in every movie, she is PERFECT for it! Type A personality, complete and utter bitch and gets away with it because people do what she says! She's on point, gotta love a woman like that! ï»¿"
"Really?  You don't think it might be...  your personality?  Your hostility towards ""white and westernized women"" who are allowed to watch movies that people in 3rd world countries can't?ï»¿"
So clearly you have messed up shit from high school which scarred you so you can relate. For the rest of us this movie was stupid.ï»¿
Waste of time.ï»¿
The movie was actually good.ï»¿
Which is the song from last minute?ï»¿
"Well, i dunno, how much is the ticket worth?ï»¿"
It is a really good movie.....u should watch it!!ï»¿
"This is clearly a film for women. To men, itâ€™s a boring absolute pile of bollocks and I wouldnâ€™t go to see it if you paid me with a winning lottery ticket.ï»¿"
Looks like a rip-off of bridesmaids but yeah i'll give it a try :)ï»¿
"Don't know what you're talking about dude, I just watched it with some nice headphones and the audio mix is perfect. As it is in most movies. You know, because they hire professionals. ï»¿"
Fat Amy and Jonah Hill make good couplesï»¿
Isla â™¥â™¥ï»¿
"Its the chick from confessions of a shopaholic, The lesbian from mean girls Mary-jane from spidermanAnd Rebel wilson from... just rebel wilson just being fucking funny. :) Woop!looks like an awesome movie. ï»¿"
love isla fisherï»¿
malasa...ï»¿
I only just remembered that Lizzy Caplan was Janice Ian :Dï»¿
FAT AMY!!!!!!! :Dï»¿
"Fuck EVERYONE!ï»¿"
Actors were wasted. Awful story. ï»¿
"They should make a Bachelorette 2, subtitled Becky's Revengeï»¿"
"Omg this is a worst movie. Has no story line, its not funny at all and the characters are lame. I turned off the movie  in 30 min i was expecting something to happen and it kept on dragging along! Worst movie do not waste your time!ï»¿"
"Nah just watch jurassic park. much better film. this is just a boring chick flick, so for men this film is just girls fucking aboutï»¿"
"Does ANYBODY at all, know the song playing in the backround when Regan (Kirsten Dunst) is sitting on the couch in the lobby waiting for the other B-Faces????ive been looking everywhere! :(ï»¿"
"Not fun at all. A bit funny. Overall, nah, no depth. They can't be mean though, they aren't scary enough, nobody lets them do that shit, rather suffering from getting names called. But Kirsten is a fucking diva.ï»¿"
"I totally agree: this movie is not just a comedy, it really has depth and the characters were really interesting. But I wouldn't say they're mean. They have this ""i-don't-care"" attitude and they do stupid shit but not out of nastiness I think... Just my 2 cents :)ï»¿"
The female version of hangover. Entertaining. Not hilarious but had some funny scenes.ï»¿
REBEL WILSON!ï»¿
fat amy and janice ian for the winï»¿
"i can now see why this didn't make it to the cinemas lolï»¿"
Fat Amy you dumbassï»¿
Awesome oh wow like totally freak me out i mean right on. The torros sure are number one. Trololololol after a decade i still remember lolololol moreï»¿
"I've watched it already - it's fat AMY (or Patricia), you moron.ï»¿"
this movie is so funny. worth the watch. ï»¿
This movie is funny as hell and the story is very different from Bridesmaidsï»¿
hangover girl's version !!! lame !!ï»¿
fuck kristen dunstï»¿
finally something worth watching has come to netflixï»¿
"Anyone who doesn't like this movie doesn't understand what's underneath it. These girls have problems and shot that they cover up by being mean. They feel the need to defend themselves and portray these ""mean-ass-carefree-bitches"" but really their all coping with the real life mental shit that scarred them in high school. It's amazing.ï»¿"
Easily one of the most underrated movies I've ever seen. The characters are dark and believable. I highly recommend it to anyone that's a fan of dark comediesï»¿
"It's a dark comedy.They are supposed to be hateful and mean. I agree it's not for everyone,but i personally loved it and think its one of the best of 2012. (:ï»¿"
"i can't really take kirsten dunst seriously anymore after she said: ""it's not a democracy it's a cheerocracy"" in bring it on lolï»¿"
I loved it! :) #netflixï»¿
Are you serious? I spent an hour waiting to get download...:(ï»¿
Lizzy Caplan is the new Winona Ryderï»¿
"These girls are all so hateful and mean.  why would anyone find this entertaining?  if it's supposed to be a comedy, it fails.  ï»¿"
Fat Amy so cute 5555  ^^ï»¿
"I think the term ""Gentleman's Club"" is meant to be ironic.ï»¿"
"i am watching it and its so stupid and mean hope it gets better her friends are selfish brats, so rude and selfish ï»¿"
This movie is not even that funny...it's kind of just plain mean! ï»¿
omg kristen dunst n isla fisher...kickass movie lolï»¿
Loove lizzy caplan!ï»¿
"""this is housekeeping, not Project Runway"" i'm like BAHAHAHAHAAAA love it!ï»¿"
"wow, I was let down by this movie.....I saw the play and trust me, its a whole lot better than this. The writer comprised her original, dark ending with a happy hollywood ending. :(ï»¿"
Favorite movie!ï»¿
fuck that movieï»¿
It's the same actressï»¿
"Good Movie! I Liked it!_Pig Faceï»¿"
my favorite part of this movie is how its on netflix:)) thank godï»¿
Fat Amy/Patricia and Janis Ian in the same film!ï»¿
Who the fuck is Fat Emmy?!ï»¿
xHaniffax fat amyï»¿
One of the worst movie!!! No story waste of my time!ï»¿
The character of Katie makes me so sad :(ï»¿
I watched this today and was disappointed. Wasn't as funny like I thought it would be. 5/10. ï»¿
This was actually made before bridesmaids but released after bridesmaids was releasedï»¿
"...pretty sure they already made this movie...it's called Bridesmaids.ï»¿"
Actually Kurt Cobain wore his pyjamas while getting married to Courtney Love.ï»¿
thumbs up if your favourite charater is katieï»¿
pitch perfect hey! I GOT IT YESTERDAY! WOO HOO!!!!!!!!!!ï»¿
ha ha .. adele .. this thing will run for a day at maxï»¿
just watched this on Netflix. Kristen Dunst carried this movie for sure!ï»¿
"""French was actually hard...."" lolï»¿"
Well I didn't know that Sienna Macy ! Jeez who do you think you areï»¿

Oh em gee this.moving was ah-mazingï»¿
"This movie is fucking hilarious. I can't stop watching it and quoting it.""REVIVING A FUCKED UP BITCH WASN'T ON THE ITINERARY EITHER! COVER FOR ME!""ï»¿"
It is -.-ï»¿
The skinny blond haired girl looks like Mary Jane in spider manï»¿
this is suchhh a good movie not gonna lieï»¿
"Oh,There's no backup dancers,i can't....ï»¿"
"I just watch this movie but the story was full of stupidity.. Baloney!!ï»¿"
why is not the name of Rebel Wilson in this trailerï»¿

"when i saw the trailer i didnt want to watch it, but a friend later reccomended this movie to me and I LOVED IT. it just brilliant. Def in my top 5. ï»¿"

It's not a great movie... ï»¿
I really didn't like this movie... I was really disappointed because I love Isla Fisher and kirsten Dunst... I don't get it? Great actors - shitty movie. Well that's just my opinion.ï»¿
Worst movie in the history of movies. Trust me. Don't waste your time.ï»¿
"Isla Fisher is HOT!!!ï»¿"
Give this movie a shot. There are alot of funny parts. And people stop comparing it to Bridesmaids!!! They are two different movies.ï»¿
Music from 0:24 ?ï»¿
"PLEASE TELL ME THAT THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE!I DOWNLOADED IT, I'M ONLY AT THE BROKEN WEDDING DRESS PART BUT I'M GIVING UP. I WAS LIKE WHAT THE HELL ARE THESE GIRLS DOING?TELL ME THAT THIS IS GREAT!ï»¿"
Lizzy Caplan is a character ï»¿
beautiful kristen gone crazyï»¿
"Dude it's not Amy or Janice, it's fucking Kat :Dï»¿"
it's Janice!ï»¿
"hey stealthgamer1911, fat girls are hot too... just a little more love in the middle, ya know.... the extra cherry on top and they are nice to cuddle with ;) (i like to cuddle)ï»¿"
"You know why hot girls has allways one ugly fat friend with them?Because they look even hotter next to this poor ugly fat girl :(ï»¿"
it's kirstenï»¿
I love this red head actressï»¿

"Why do you notice race?ï»¿"

"esta es una de las mejoreeeeeeeees actuaciones que he visto de kristen, el cual no hacia un papel de perra infeliz desde bring it on jajajaja bueno e fin es buena la pelÃ_cula ï»¿"
this trailer is really confusing.ï»¿
This looks fuckin stupid. ï»¿
thats it!! :)ï»¿
"Definitely, Maybe <3ï»¿"
"can i just say that this is the worst movie BY FAR since sex and the city 2, and let's admit it, sex and the city 2 was reaaaaaaaaally awful, and humiliating... Here you have a set of three woman who apparently got lobotomised and are bitching bitching and bitching...most useless use of my time since dating a premature ejaculator. ï»¿"
I love Rebel Wilson so much!ï»¿
I love Rebel Wilson she is so funny lmfaoï»¿

She'll always be Fat Amy to meï»¿
"Jonah Hill?ï»¿"
janis ianï»¿
"Just saw this movie. Absolute crap. Maybe if you have the right sense of humor, you'll find this funny. I consider myself to have a pretty broad range of a sense of humor, and i didnt laugh once this whole movie. and the characters were terrible people. there was no point in the movie where i was like, ""i want this character to win in the end!"" or anything like that. it was really just a movie about shallow, ignorant girls who ruin a nice girl's wedding, and then they get away with it. ï»¿"
"This movie is gross and it sucks. Bad stupid people, inappropriate and so no funny. too bad..ï»¿"
"""I have a confession. My name is really Fat Patricia.""ï»¿"
"i watched this movie high as fuck and it was funny as shit, BUT now im lookin at the trailer and it looks gay as fuck!ï»¿"
rebels hardly in it? and the title of the movie reps her lolï»¿
FAT AMYY â™¥pitch perfect!ï»¿
"I don't get if Rebel was one of the main characters why wasn't she one of the names in the trailer, was this just after bridesmaids before she was big here?ï»¿"
ugly girls doesnt exist..just girl nice then other!!ï»¿
This movie looks like shit.ï»¿
I loved this movie!ï»¿

"Mean girls!ï»¿"
"Nice wig, Janis...ï»¿"
LOVED ADAM SCOTT AND LIZZY CHAPLAN or as you say Clyde and gena :) they made the movie. I loved their story best.ï»¿
There's an airbourne track !! In a movie !! ï»¿
"Rebel Wilson isn't like the derpy girl she was in Pitch Perfect and Bridesmaids.Omg, she acts like she does in those movies like she does irl.Shame she's not the same in this movie.ï»¿"
"that's from mean girls movie :)ï»¿"
"You guys remember that party we invited her to where we had over 10,000 gummy bears from Costco, and my mom told Lizzy that if she was going to stay the night, she had to sleep in the lesbian room? She went in there, all excited, and realized she was the only one in there. We were all sleeping in the straight girl room, with our gummy bears.She told us that she gave Tim a handie, and should get to come back into the straight girl room, but it was too late at that point, we didn't let her.ï»¿"
Oh hey JANICE I guess your hair grew back.ï»¿
fun fun!!!ï»¿
This movie was absolutely hilarious!!! I liked it more than Bridesmaids to be honest...ï»¿
Da fuq? :Oï»¿
It's the girl from mean girlsï»¿

"Highfive! I felt the same way! I watched Bridesmaids after it was so hyped up and so perhaps that's why I found it disappointing, but it was really rather cheesy and nothing special. I think it got so much recognition because Kristen Wiig & female comedians and all that. It was alright, but nothing special or original. A maid of honor who gets jealous when her best friend gets attached to some new girl, and then falls in love with a cop after ignoring him... ï»¿"
"To each his own, but I loved this movie. And perhaps if you watched the whole thing you would think so too. Everyone keeps comparing this to Bridesmaids and I admit when I read the description I thought the same thing. But they completely diff. vibes. Personally I preferred it to Bridesmaids. (I also thought Bridesmaids was boring/slow until the dress fitting). This is realistic and actually has layers as opposed to just another fluffy formulaic comedy. ï»¿"
REBEL WILSON!!!ï»¿
"i watched a part of this movie, and I couldn't watch it all. It's boring. I got so excited watching the trailer and then the movie dissapointed me. it was too ""slow"" compering to the trailerï»¿"
Does somebody know the song you hear at the end of the movie?ï»¿
This is an AWESOME MOVIE!! You neeeeed to watch it :Dï»¿

"This looks so hilarious, when does this come out?ï»¿"
This was WAY MUCH BETTER than Bridemaids. ï»¿
the ginger looks soo funny in thisï»¿
I don't think that is a bad thingï»¿
Is this based on the play of the same name?ï»¿
bridesmaids 2? basicallyï»¿
Did this movie come out already?ï»¿
Little known fact: this film is actually a spinoff of the Fat Pizza episode where Toulah married Habib.ï»¿
none of these girls look like they'd even talk to each other..ï»¿

Awesome movieï»¿

"Janis: We gotta crack Gretchen Wieners. We crack Gretchen, and then we crack the lock on Regina's whole dirty history.Damian: Say crack again.Janis: Crack.""It's ike a Jane Austen novel on crack""And now I guess she's on crack!ï»¿"

"Can't believe IMDB ratings for this movie are so low...I mean..they rated ""American pie. reunion"" 7 and this one gets only 5.3??? It's a joke.ï»¿"

This must be the worst film I have ever seen in my lifeï»¿
"Taked me a long time to recognize that brunette actress, she played Janis in Mean Girls. nice to see her in another movie!ï»¿"
Rebel Wilson <3ï»¿
"This comes off a little like Bridesmaids from the trailer, I agree. BUT, you have to watch it. It's like Bridemaids did a LOT of coke, then got really really fucking hot. It's such a funny movie!**SPOILER ALERT**""Reagan! We have a catastrophe here, can you help us fix the fuckin dress?!""ï»¿"
It's CAPLAN! Not Caplinï»¿

Female Jonah Hill?ï»¿
"I was really excited to see this film based on this trailer, but the characters were poorly written and non-relatable.  Their choices and actions made no sense.  They were just a bunch of shitty ass selfish friends who fucked up everything from being complete dumbasses.  /rantï»¿"
"PLEASE, what is the song that starts in the background at 1:52?Thanks!ï»¿"
HYou could watch this ooooorrrrrrrrr PARTY DOWN!ï»¿

we're quoting mean girls... but okay ï»¿
Bridesmaids with a dash of The Hangover.ï»¿
"Terrible movie. They`re just smoking, using, fucking, drinking all the time. And the word "" dick"" is what will you hear the most in the movie. If you making the movie like that with a taste, maybe its even funny, but this? Just lame, im sorry.  What a waste on such a great actresses. Im very disappointed. ï»¿"
This reminds me of bridesmaid and the hangover. ï»¿
It's janice from mean girls!ï»¿
best movie everrr..its like mean girls but in the real world and all grown up...:D ï»¿
Ugly bitch3s why?ï»¿
"Honestly I'm really excited to see this film. It looks promising, and it looks to me like it will deliver in all the ways that Bridesmaids didn't. Plus, I fucking love Kirsten Dunst.ï»¿"
She's like a Blonde Adele!ï»¿
Movie made for chicks by chicksï»¿
Maybe she'll wear a wig.... Made from YOUR MOMS CHEST HAIRï»¿
Worst mobie i never seen before just trash ehhï»¿
"Lizzy Caplan, Adam Scott, and No shitty Kristen Whig?? Wow, this ight actualy be a funny version of Bridesmaids. Nice.ï»¿"

ISLA .......ï»¿
"COPYCATS.ï»¿"
Is it just me or am I getting dÃ©jÃ  vu? Because this reminds me of Bridemaids.ï»¿
she is credited...ï»¿
"Lizzy Caplan and Adam Scott need to get married, they would be the most awesome couple the planet has ever seenï»¿"
.. The only reason I came here to see the trailer is because I been seeing Rebel do alot of promoting and she is funny so i thought the movie would be also but it's NOT prefer the Hang Over 1ï»¿
I wouldn'tï»¿
you know who got married in his pajamas KURT COBAIN!ï»¿
"she was always skinny, she was just ""gothic"" in that movieï»¿"
"YO BECKY, SAY WHAT! YOU ARE GETTING MARRIED!!! *clap clap*best scene, EVER xDï»¿"

Such a good movie watched it two times already :)ï»¿
*Kirstenï»¿
"This looks...absolutely...terrible...Don't they usually take the best parts of the movie for the trailer? If that's the case, what is the rest of this train wreck going to be like???ï»¿"
this is the kinda shitty movies Hollywood makes when they dont remake european or asian films.  ï»¿
HEY beacky SAY WHAT! youre getting married omg hehahaï»¿
"Kristen Dunst deserves an Oscar fot this roll, she was incredibleï»¿"
Its a Bridesmaids Rip-Offï»¿
"Shitty, boring movie. A lot worse than Bridesmaids.ï»¿"
better than bridesmaids. ï»¿
Andrew Rannells <3ï»¿
Ugh James Marsden is not in this trailer nearly enough. He'd better be in the film more.ï»¿
What the fuck is Mean Girls? And why should I know what what it is kiddo?ï»¿
The last sentence is actually a line from Mean Girls.. My goodness you're an innocent little kid! ï»¿
"So you're thanking me for having a brain, and then insulting me for using it? My goodness aren't you an adorable little kid? And thanks for mentioning that everyone loves me, I don't like to brag about things like that. you on the other hand do come across as quite the dickhead! Enjoy your fruit salad with tomato on the side!!!!!!!!!!!ï»¿"
YOUR MOMS CHEST HAIRï»¿
0:32ï»¿
this movie is so fantastic. ï»¿
0:58 - 1:06 LOL!ï»¿
Watch the whole movie on my channel!!!ï»¿
"The female version of ""The Hangover"" Am I right??ï»¿"
"I really like the awkward dialogue in Braidsmaids, it literally felt like those characters where having a conversion normal people would have, as if it was unscripted. I just hope this film follows the same style. ï»¿"
"Congratulations! It's obvious that you already have that in your head! You didn't use the f*cking internet! Woohoo! You think everybody is in love with you but actually everyone hates you!ï»¿"
"Nice wig Janis, what's it made of?ï»¿"
In scientific terms a tomato is in fact a fruit But in cuisine it is in fact classed as a vegetable! You just don't get tomatoes in a fruit salad!ï»¿
"No, just a fat chick, nothing more!ï»¿"
Because no one really cares! That they named the other three idiots is a miracle!ï»¿
"I love how at the end it names the three bridemaids actresses but not the bride actress. Like seriously, the fuck!? hahaï»¿"
token fat chick imoï»¿
"You're dumb. Only dumb people would give opinions on matters that they know nothing about. You do know that a tomato is a fruit, right?ï»¿"
dumbass waste of film- overratedï»¿
LOL this is a lame version of bridesmaids ï»¿
"Bridesmaids is funnier but for some reason i liked this better. It is raunchier, meaner and more honest. The performances are superb especially Dunst and Lizzy Caplan. ï»¿"
"Kirsten Dunst seems all out of this movie, like she doesn't fit in there :\ï»¿"
Why am I having deja vu seeing Lizzy Caplan and Adam Scott together? Has this happened before? LOLï»¿
is that the puerto rican girl from mean girls? or middle eastern girl whatever...ï»¿
I fucking loved this movie!ï»¿
Kirsten is also misspelled.ï»¿
Gotta c this!ï»¿
"Its CAPLAN! Not Caplin :\ Anyhow, i'll go see it a million times just because shes in it!!!!!! sooo excited!ï»¿"
I have to see this.ï»¿
JAMES MARSDEN!!!!ï»¿
the female version of The Hangoverï»¿
I honestly wanted this movie to be good because I like all these actresses anf actors and really thought it was going to be a rom com with a great love story. But I ended up disappointed. The only good storyline in here was between Lizzy Caplan's character and her ex. That's where the real love story was. The second best part was how much the bride valued her friendship with kirsten dunst. Other than that...it was a let down. But the parts I liked made up for it I guess.ï»¿
Fat Amy! xDï»¿
i like kristen dunst and isla fisher but its really a boring movie....ï»¿
"Im gonna walk in, in my pijamas, like im Michael Jackson...ï»¿"
YO BECKY! SAY WHAT?!? YOU GETTIN MARRIED!!!ï»¿
then you obviously have no taste in comedyï»¿
I've seen it and it's really dark and hilarious.ï»¿
THIS IS HOUSEKEEPING  !! NOT PROJECT RUNWAY LOLOLOLOLOLï»¿

THIS MOVIE IS SO GOOD!ï»¿
Rebel Wilson should be in the title!ï»¿
I love Isla fisherï»¿
"This just looks like Bridesmaids but way, way worse.ï»¿"
ok was so eager to see this wen readin it on paper but honestly this trailer is makin it seem lik its tryin too hard to jump on The Bridesmaids bandwagon likï»¿
The fat bride looks like Jonah Hill with a blonde wig on!ï»¿
so much better than Bridesmaids.ï»¿
Song at :24 ??ï»¿
SOOOO F****** funny! WATCH it :Dï»¿

this was a reallyyyyyyyyyy bad movie !!!!ï»¿
@Wiz83ï»¿
omg Janice Ian!! ï»¿
lolï»¿
"Ha, yea, I feel like absolutely nobody has heard of Melancholiaï»¿"

"I laughed so fucking hard on this one  ahahahahaahahahahahahahaha""I'll lick it too"" ahahahahahahahahaï»¿"
"are you kidding? i thought this film was hilarious! i don't usually watch films like this either but i watched it at work and i was cracking up so badly, i thought it was a great movie with great actors :)ï»¿"
This looks like a shittier version of Bridesmaids !ï»¿

"kinda a dark comedy, but i liked it ï»¿"
well .. this is the current situation we live in XD everyone is fake !! ï»¿
"This was the most amazing movie ever ï»¿"

Love this movie!ï»¿
THIS SUCKS! lol ï»¿
Bridesmates PART II ? ï»¿
Hahaha omfg :D Niceee movieee haha :D ï»¿
The fact that they used to make fun of her makes me sad. I know it's just a movie though. Just don't like fake people.ï»¿
well do any of them get naked at least?ï»¿
buh I just watched this movie. IT'S HORRIBLE. I was hoping for it to be a bridesmaids 2 type film. It's not funny at all and takes these really good actors and makes them look super shitty. ï»¿
"its different from bridesmaids, trust me, just the same setting everything else is different ï»¿"
"i saw it, its kinda good and hilarious ï»¿"
*song* AIRBOURNE - Blonde Bad And Beautifulï»¿
"did not like the movie, all about sex and drugs ewwwwï»¿"
Is it just me or doesn't the big girl look like rebecca black? seriously they have the same face?!ï»¿
Melancholia sucked so bad... ï»¿
"This was actually very good and very funny. If you don't think so, then maybe you just don't get the humor. Lizzy Caplan steals the show, like always. ï»¿"
Just what I was thinking. I'ts like Know one knows how to make intriguing trailers.ï»¿
Awful. Just awful.ï»¿
another trailer with the whole film in it.ï»¿
is she the female version of jonah hill? ï»¿
....is this the Bridesmaids movie cousin? :|ï»¿
soooooo Bridesmaids?ï»¿
it's soooo weird hearing Rebel Wilson with an American accentï»¿
Is that Taylor Lautner at 1:51?ï»¿
but NOT mainstream alive.....so she is kinda deadï»¿
"Wow, beautiful. Simply spot on pal. ï»¿"
"She's not chubby, she's undoubtedly fat. Overweight. Obese. Gross. Oh and, it's you're* :) ï»¿"
"Not to mention, she's only 30!ï»¿"
ew it's that peas girl from bridesmaids BLEHHHHHH -___________-ï»¿
Could this be any more similar than Bridesmaids... jesus it's a blatant ripoff. It even has the obese pale girl in it. ï»¿
"*Kirsten. And while she took some time off, she was nominated for a ton of awards for last year's ""Melancholia,"" and won best actress at Cannes. So she's definitely still alive.ï»¿"
Cyclops is fucking Mary Janeï»¿
Damn i wonder why people keep pumping money into movies that they know are going to be shit. ï»¿
"This looks so insanely stupid. Shame too, good actresses.ï»¿"
"looks like a wannabe ""bridesmaids""... but i'm still gonna watch it :/ lolï»¿"
IT'S JANIS!!!!! ï»¿
"""Blonde, Bad and Beautiful"" by Airbourne. Awesome song by an awesome band.ï»¿"
Going to watch it because of Lizzy. She's fucking badass :Pï»¿
this is such a chick movie. cause retarded mindless entertainment. lizzy caplan is still hotï»¿
"I loved Bridesmaids,I can't wait for this.But gosh,now Kirsten Wig have patented bridesmaids and weddings?The story is completely different,nothing to do with the other movie.ï»¿"
Check out this movie at Evideos.Tk it s been leaked there ï»¿

This movie is all lies! Janice Ian was NOT friends with Mary Jane in high school! Pssh!ï»¿
I will see anything Lizzy Caplan is in. Sign me up. ï»¿
"u stupid idiot!it is NOT (i repeat) NOT like bridesmaids and doesn't resemble it from any imaginable angle, so shut the fuck up already, asswholeï»¿"
"Is the Stripper the guy from ""The Book of Mormon""?ï»¿"
"Rebel! Woo! Great to see her in more American movie, but her accent sounds soooo wierd to me. This could be interesting. I'll wait and see.ï»¿"
"good to see kirsten againï»¿"
I'm gonna go see this just because Janis Ian is in it. (Thumbs for reference.)ï»¿
i think you summed it up in a sentence lol xxxï»¿
So it's about 3 mean bridesmaids ruining the wedding of a girl they don't like?ï»¿
Bridesmaids.ï»¿
Pitch Perfect looks much more Bridesmaid's centric than this does. ï»¿
when will rebel wilson start getting headlined?ï»¿
"Eerr Enlgish is also an accent, from this place called England...you might have heard of it...our Queen lives there...ï»¿"
"If this is the shit that gets you to jizz, then your life must suck. lol and again I advise you to check again. It was written way before September 2011. ï»¿"
that's Janice from Mean Girls!!!!ï»¿
"I changed my mind. This is too much fun. Please be sure to also check Kirsten Dunst's official website for the picture set entitled ""On Set of Bachelorette - September 21, 2011"". Fuck I love it when I'm right.ï»¿"
"popsugar(dot)com also has an article detailing the actresses as being seen filming ""Last night"". The post is dated Sep 2, 2011. I could go on. But you get my point.ï»¿"
"Filming in New York's Prospect Park according to article written on September 22, 2011 on The Daily Mail site (I'd post a link, but Youtube doesn't allow it). Google it, fuckstick.Cross reference that with a first person account on IMDB (note date of post as Sep 21, 2011 informing interested people of said filming). Feel free to go to ""Bachelorette"" on IMDB & check comment titled ""Filming in Prospect Park""But don't fret. I don't hold grudges. Especially against the retarded.ï»¿"
The bride is the same girl from bridesmaids. Her bridesmaids were not in the movieï»¿
I mean they even have some of the same people as in bridesmaids. this is just sad.ï»¿
its not the same blonde fat chick fuck u...ï»¿
0:59 who's the girl in the leopard print? She got moves and she's hotï»¿
i see james marsden... thats enough for meï»¿
"whch song is at 0.25????????????ï»¿"
"Well, a quick internet check turned up the fact that you are a fucking idiot. The movie was still being filmed as of late September 2011. Let's see, Bridesmaids was released in April of that year. Yeah. So. Fuck you.ï»¿"
"Oh, dear. Whatever shall I do?ï»¿"
"I thought she was british sorry :/, i know her name it just was in the moment, and you know what i meant lol. its been a LONGGGGG night, I'm a little messed up.ï»¿"
"i honestly dont understand this comment? ... first off she's Australian, her name is Rebel wilson (Fat Amy was a character she played in a skit show.) and english is a language not an accent, I think you meant American? :/ï»¿"
I hate how they made the normally british fat amy speak english in stead of british.ï»¿
This looks horribleï»¿
So they make a movie that looks like a rip off of Bridesmaids and they even use the same blonda fat chick? C'mon!!ï»¿
wow.. airbourne soundtrack!!ï»¿
"I shall not judge a movie I haven't seenI shall not judge a movie I haven't seenI shall not judge a movie I haven't seenï»¿"
"Yeah I agree, it looks like a watered down, we couldn't afford the best writers so we had to go with these cheaper/amateur writers to write us a weak story line with un-funny jokes version of Bridesmaids lol. ï»¿"
"didn't this movie come out in 2010?ï»¿"
"Aside from the fact that this looks like a crappy Bridesmaids cash-in...... Lizzy Caplan and Adam Scott reunion for the win! Party Down forever!ï»¿"

Why they chose Jena Malone rather than Lizzy Caplan for Johanna Mason role? :( ï»¿
Both of them can.....ï»¿
What's the name of the song? ï»¿
But Adams CAN actually act...ï»¿
"Uhh okay, Bridesmaids?ï»¿"
