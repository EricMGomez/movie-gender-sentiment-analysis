Got very teary eyed watching this one. Miss Paris xï»¿
Quelle vignette prÃ©fÃ©rez-vous?ï»¿
American Tourist. The one I remember after yearsï»¿
"I bought the DVD of ""PARIS JE T'AIME"" on Monday 23rd. January 2017, watched it avidly, thoroughly enjoyed it & will definitelyÂ watch it again.Â With 18 unique Â Love Stories directed by a brilliant gathering of talent, in my personal opinion it was 18 times better than the over-hyped ""LA LA LAND""!ï»¿"
Malcolm Fisher congratsï»¿
"What""s Lalala?ï»¿"
it was a movie?! I just saw this in a t-shirt in the movie 10 cloverfield lane LOLï»¿
"yeap, it isï»¿"
The best movie I ever seen.ï»¿
this is a remarkable film!ï»¿
What's the name of the song in the trailer and by who? ï»¿
Feist - We're all in the dance :)ï»¿
0:35 - 0:39ï»¿
"This one is much more better than NY I luv u, so I'll recommend you watch this one.ï»¿"
"There are so many different moods in this movie it is impossible not to love at least one ! ... And not to hate at least one too, by the way.ï»¿"
"paris j ai t aime was the first of the two...trust me it has nothing to do with new york i love you.the second one is a very unfortunate and sluppy pudding  of the first one....almost annoyingï»¿"
I didn't really liked New York I love you... But I'll try to watch this one... Could be nice :)ï»¿
"Actually, i fall in love with this film.ï»¿"
"This shot gun barrel taste so good , I miss you baby .ï»¿"
I feel a crying finale coming on...ï»¿
really good film- although its quite serious in some scenes it has some humour to cheer you back up again =)ï»¿
I can not wait to come backï»¿
"Ah, Paris. Qu'est-ce qu'elle est belle! Hey, if anyone's interested, I've just posted up a new music video ""sunset in Paris."" Would love some feedback. Thanks so much! ï»¿"
