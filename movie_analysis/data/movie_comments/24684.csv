"Sorry, I prefer David's friend ;)ï»¿"
I know right. David is eww.ï»¿
a really nice oneï»¿
That's such a disturbing relationship...ï»¿
"""I feel old but not very wise""ï»¿"
I can't help but notice that Peter Sarsgaard's chest hair is shaped like a tree.ï»¿
"she thought her teacher was a low life writing boring poems when she adviced her on continuing her education. She said she had been to great restaurants and concerts and lived. ha ! Bitch got what she deserved, a lesson !ï»¿"
A Wonderful Education!Â ï»¿

Just finished watching this movie. Lesson learned? Stay in school.ï»¿
Remember this was the 1960s--long before the libtards tried to criminalize teenage girls making their own choices as to who to sleep with!! Even girls had rights to choose back then!ï»¿
Don't complain if your 16 year old daughter decides to go out with a 35 year old. Or are you saying this because you want to date schoolgirls?ï»¿
1st of all he is trying to say don't plan your future to much becaue you might end up being disappointed by what actually ends up happening. 2nd of all the man in the movie isn't very old. only about 5-7 years older than the teenager. and last of all most teenage girls do fantasize about meeting someone a bit older than them because they think the boys their age are immature. ï»¿
"what teenage girl fantasizes about a old perverted man, ewww. if your a teenager and you consider someone in the slightest who is old enough to be your dad, you have problemsï»¿"
One of the best movies of all time.ï»¿
amazing acting.. beautiful cinematography... :)ï»¿
beautiful movie .ï»¿
<3ï»¿
"Cate Blanchette is australian, other than that i agree with your point!ï»¿"
"Exactly. Emma Thompson is amazing, Mulligan and Winslet aren't the only two great actors Britain's produced!ï»¿"
"I love this movie soo much ..Everytime i watch it ,it  brings tears in my eyes. Probably one of the only movie that teaches me great lesson. IF WE NEVER DID ANYTHING WE WOULD NOT BE ANYBODY.ï»¿"
"Cate Blanchette, Tilda Swinton, I could name many more, but must run to gym before it closes. Don't limit yourself on great Brit actresses, which are many.ï»¿"
"Tilda Swinton, Rachel Weisz, Emma Thompson? I agree that Mulligan and Winslet are fantastic actresses but personally there's so much British acting talent; I'd be hard pressed to choose just 2 and declare them the greatest?ï»¿"
coolï»¿
"I agree with the first comment saying those two are great british actresses, but Emma Thompson can give them a run for their money!! All three of them are fabulous... <3ï»¿"
why not boys?ï»¿
Apparently Emma Thompson does't know how to act.ï»¿
"awh, that's said so lovelyï»¿"
carrey mullighan is a modern day audrey hephern you only have kate winslet and carrey mullighan as the greatest brithish actress  of our timeï»¿
"Good movie :)ï»¿"
"This is a wonderful film,makes me feel all fancylike:)ï»¿"
she was amazing in this film.. amazing.. ï»¿
......ï»¿
yeah she says that....I love this lineï»¿
"No. When I saw the film, I was unprepared for the big reveal, and this trailer gives no indication about it.ï»¿"
"actions character, if we never did anything, we wouldn't be anybody2:02ï»¿"
alfred molina speaks spanish>?ï»¿
like twilight !ï»¿
she is a hot slutï»¿
If only. ï»¿
"A beautiful cautionary tale for girls fantasizing about their futures. Yes, of course the romantic concept of an older man sweeping you off your feet, taking you places, and taking care of you without need of schooling is charming, but the reality of it can be quite crushing. I sincerely recommend this to all girls. ï»¿"
Oh My God Alfred Molina. Thumbs up if you geddit!!ï»¿
"Clueless self-destructive girl fucks-up her life throwing herself at a lying cheating manipulative douche-bag.Sounds pretty realistic to me.ï»¿"
@GodWorse it's amazing ï»¿
"I absolutely loved this film.ï»¿"
@lucycatherinex I think he's supposed to be like 30.ï»¿
watch this film like 6 times already. love it:)ï»¿
how is the song called? please! i need to knowï»¿
@obscurity87 very trueï»¿
@RondoFan9999 and boring ;)ï»¿
I hate that bastard of David!!!!!! Jenny was Lovely :)ï»¿
@gela85 and  gudluck for ur rest of ur lifeï»¿
"@gela85  the movie wasnt actually being in love with an older man,it was being in love with this new life that the guy was showing Jenny  because as she said before him everything was so boring and then she understood that life wasnt what she thoughtï»¿"
what a beautiful movieï»¿
this movie is so inspiring..it inspires people to learn from their mistakes and reach their full potential no matter what has happened in the past. ï»¿
"""my choice is to do something hard""lmfaoï»¿"
i was 16 and my boyfriend was 29. i could really relate to jenny. you feel so in love and excited with an older boyfriend. and until now were still together and married.ï»¿
"@xXxxxxXx584 nah no way, at 18 people start to see you as an adult, but a young one, people only really start treating you like a regular adult in your mid 20s, but obviously it varies depending on maturityï»¿"
@xXxxxxXx584 I'm 16 and British and I wish I was treated like an adult :/ï»¿
"The thing I didn't like about this was that Jenny's dad was so intent on her studies and education, and then when she started getting serious with David, her dad was perfectly fine with her marrying him!ï»¿"
there is to much shit in this movie.ï»¿
"Just out of curiosity, was the grand place where the characters of Rosamund Pike and Dominic Cooper live anywhere near Regents Street? because it looks so familiar. I think I got lost a bit last year with all the no entry signs, just started driving in and out of those roads while of course admiring the view.ï»¿"
"I love the trailer, but he looks like a pedophile, he looks like hes 40 and shes 16 xD lmaoï»¿"
"the title is ""An Education"" by Lynn Barber. It's about her whole life, not just the teenage years with David (who originally was called Simon, David was Barber's husband). She writes about her journalist career and has a funny, decesious style. I like it. ï»¿"
Never mind Kate Middleton - I want to marry Carey Mulligan!ï»¿
"She's come a long way from Pride & Prejudice.She seems like a totally different actress now. She shows so much talent. Although it seems she's lost a bit of weight since P&P (which I am currently watching, so just saying). Love her! ï»¿"
"i love the movie. i just watched it. it's amazing and even that is an understatement. she was flawless in the film and the movie was almost perfectdefinetly one of my favorite movies of all time :)ï»¿"
@biriccina  the book is called?ï»¿
she dies at the endï»¿
"Nice movie, I like it, but I read the book about that girl and I really love it. Read it! ï»¿"
Simply beautiful film. Carey Mulligan is such a natural! She was so amazing in the film. ï»¿
just saw this now what a lovely movie!ï»¿
I love her she's amazing!ï»¿
"she was exceptional is Never Let Me Go, so i cannot wait to see this film.ï»¿"
wow the trailer sucks compared to the movie.ï»¿
This movie was fabulousï»¿
this movie was just so good... MAJOR SPOILER ALERT but was I the only one who noticed that his wife and son were the same ones crossing the street the rainy day david met jenny?ï»¿
@streetworm21 synopsis: young cunt gets fucked by rich old cunt around other dumb cuntsï»¿
carey mulligan made a fan of me in this movie. i love it.ï»¿
i absolutely adore carey mulligan.ï»¿
a very beautiful movie.ï»¿
he was such a charmer wasn't he...ï»¿
"""actions build character..if we never did anything, we would never be anybody""ï»¿"
"fantastic film...happy new year!ï»¿"
"One of the best films of the past few years. I loooove Carey Mulligan so much- she is absolutely adorable!!Does anybody else think though that this trailer gives too much away??!ï»¿"
"What's with  Olivia Williams and OXFORD UNIV.? The film really worth seeing... is Polanski's  thriller and eye-opener... The Ghost Writer.She's in it... and very good, whatsmore (as are ALL the cast).ï»¿"
"If we never did anything, we wouldn't be anybody. Every teenage girl on this planet should watch this movie.ï»¿"
"@stupidintellect90 Yea, watch garden state, hes amazing in itï»¿"
"EXCELLENT movie! Absolutely brilliant. Peter Sarsgaard voice, as well as accent did annoy me quite a bit, though.ï»¿"
"Wow, this movie looks really good. Looks like a worthy Best Picture nominee. ï»¿"
The only two films which star Peter Sarsgaard that I've seen are ones which he plays a villain and American...so he kind of creeps me out...btw is he American?ï»¿
"@ninamikou and how many people have you met who have ""achieved"" the life they want through short cut or otherwise? As far as I'm aware there are very few - hence there are far too many people who way into their adult life say things like ""school was the best years of my life""!ï»¿"
crap moviesï»¿
"I love this movie.every girl faces some temptation during their grown-up.but i am so happy to see jenny,finally understand the meaning of life and love.and i am so happy to see myself never lose my mind and the heart to pursue my dream.i was lost,but i beat it. Favorite quote""there is no shortcut to achieve the life we want."" school,study is sometime boring and hard,but we get educated,we learnt the meaning of life from it.ï»¿"
I love this movie.:)ï»¿
Care Mulligan was robbed an Oscar!!ï»¿
"really good movie, I am actually 18 and I'm dating with an older man, and I totally felt identified with this movie beside the ending, and i believe that everything that they do about going to clubs jazz paris and stuff its pretty cool in the beginning and obviously more fun than study the hole day but if you drop off school just because a boy man whatever its pretty dump, she could be much more smarter than him and stay no matter what happens there's time for everything in this lifeï»¿"
"Peter Saarsgard is an amazing actor, and Carey Mulligan... wow. She's great! Can't wait to see it!ï»¿"
i so want 2 see this bt don t know whether it got good reviews.suggestions pls?ï»¿
"@Anaksunamen999 danny is davids business partner so i guess hes like a con artist too. i think helen is just a dumb blonde who doesnt really care about what they do and just goes along with them for the fun, clothes, and partiesï»¿"
what exactly do helen and danny do? are they con artists or art stealers? I wish it was more explained.ï»¿
This movie confirms that most men are true assholesï»¿
You dont know how boring was my life before i met you.. ï»¿

i want to see this movie so bad when did it come out?ï»¿
"@misterioustranger The sense of humour you have is not a humour or a sense, it's just idiotic to call people peodphiles when u clearly dont know anything about them. I guess you haven't been tought any manners.ï»¿"
