Michael Clarke Duncan R.I.P Legend .ï»¿
"Michael Clarke Duncan was ROBBED at the Oscars. I love Michael Caine but that was a shitty American accent, and role that wasnâ€™t as sympathetic as John Coffey. Michael Clarke Duncan should have taken that Oscar.ï»¿"
INRIâ€¢:-)ï»¿
why cant all movies be like this? all the new movies are nothing but crap!ï»¿
"One of the best. I just read the book again, and realized that for the first time ever, the movie is better than the book. Sorry Stephen King.ï»¿"

"This movie, brother where are tho and a time to kill made me hate southern white people. Also made me feel glade that white people died in the civil war and ww2.ï»¿"
"John Daly, I mean no disrespect, but you seem to be generalizing about us. As a southern white person, I can attest that racism, as well as other bigoted ideals, does not stand in my family or in any family with which we associate. As for the films you mentioned in your comment, they showcase the early twentieth century, not necessarily the way southerners act now. I am in no way speaking for all of us, but I can say that not every white southern person fits the stereotype.ï»¿"
A movie doesnt get any better than thisï»¿
first comment 2017ï»¿
One of the best movies ever made if not the best. All Steven King's adaptations are incredible. The man is a genius.ï»¿
"Michael Clark Duncan died on September 3rd, and my brother Michael died on June 3rd. Best movie in the world. Thank you Michael Clark Duncan.ï»¿"

"This film is...10/10, this is one of the most best movies I've ever seen. It was sad at the end how the Family of the 2 dead girls didn't know John Coffey didn't killed their Daughters it was actually they're Painter.ï»¿"
"shittest trailer omg, gimme back my 2 minutes you fucking thieflangï»¿"
"Not as good as Titanic, but still one of the best films ever made.ï»¿"
He didn't deserve the dark... He didn't deserve it...ï»¿
i dont get it whats this movie about?ï»¿
"Stephen King thought ""What if Jesus appeared in another era? And what if instead of say a Jew in Roman occupied Palestine, he wasn't another oppressed minority like say a black man in the segregation era South?""And he made this story from that idea.ï»¿"
"What is the second song used in this trailer? I know that the first one is from the horse whisperer, the second one is from the shawshank redemption but I don't know the name of the track. Can anyone tell me? Thank youï»¿"
"the second song used in the trailer is also from the horse whisperer, the track is called montana. I purposely brought the soundtrack just for the strength of this song. I don't recall the song ever been used on the shawshank redemption.ï»¿"
"Jay L1471 Please whats the very first songï»¿"
"The first song used in this Trailer is Thomas Newman - The Rhythm Of The Horse and the second is Thomas Newman Montana, both from the movie The Horse Whisperer. Thomas Newman also made the score for Green Mile as well.ï»¿"

"god damn john coffey, stop cutting them onions.ï»¿"
its the greatest movie of all time in my opinion.ï»¿

Shawshank redemption 2ï»¿

Shawshank takes place after the 30s.ï»¿
I swear This movie made me Cry more than titanic or the notebook _Ÿ˜_ a beautiful masterpiece indeedï»¿
That's because this is a real movieï»¿
+Michael Swainy so people can suck the bad stuff outta you? sickï»¿
+keets xox he means that this movie deals with raw emotions and portrays realistic human emotionsï»¿
+Borntokirune oh ohkay thank sï»¿
@BorntokiruneÂ thanks for explaining to himï»¿
Michael Swainy Titanic is a real movie. A masterpiece. The Notebook on the other hand is utter shit.ï»¿
i keep thinking of mice and men when I watch the trailerï»¿
im  not the only one http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120689/reviews-980?mode=desktopï»¿
only one with any senseï»¿
"When this came out I was 23. I saw it twice in theaters and then bought the deev when it came out a few months later. I figured if Shawshank was a 10, this was a solid 9. But when I put it on again this past week for the first time in about 6 or 7 years, I'm only realizing now it's every bit as good as Shawshank in its very own way. What a good movie.ï»¿"
+Jason Marcel It most ceirtanly is my friend. This is my favorite movie of all time. Everything in it is perfect! I had me weeping 4 times and i'm a grown man.ï»¿
"shawshank was good but it was lighter, it tells everything about life in prison as it is, so it's more realistic .. The green mile has more shocking or extreme scenes, it has more specific plot, it's also funnier, when they kept putting that guy in solitary it was so funny, overall the green mile moved me more than shawshank did, and it was more memorable for me, because everything about it was out of the ordinary.ï»¿"
I watched this to see what tte characters look like and... does Percy die?!?! Spoilers!! :0ï»¿
Aww still SPOILERS!ï»¿
Finaly a good trailer that doesn't spoil the whole movie.ï»¿
Best film I ever seen 10/10ï»¿

"Is this better watching alone or with friends?I have this weird tendency to categorize movies in this fashion lolï»¿"
You would watch it with friends!!!ï»¿
"+DronesInJail That you're even asking tells me I should say to watch it alone. I was 23 when it came out and insisted on going to see it alone because at nearly 3 hours, I wanted no distractions. Friends and family are all nice and good, but too many of 'em don't have attention spans anymore so I categorize movies that way, too, and for the longer ones especially, I go it alone. Total immersion and no distraction.ï»¿"
"@Jason MarcelÂ Ye I watched it alone. Funny how I'm 22, god dammit 1 year gap for it to mean something hahaï»¿"
"Wow, first time I watched this trailer, I'm in tears.....ï»¿"
A masterpiece :')ï»¿
3 hours long awful movie half the movie is about a mouseï»¿

This and saving private ryan will be one of the best movies i ever watched... I m still yet to find a movie better than this one.. sure shawshank redemption was great.. but this was the first movie which made me cry like a baby...

NEED to know the song at 0:14!!!ï»¿
The whole soundtrack in this trailer is from the movie the horse whisperer...ï»¿
"words cannot describe how powerful this movie is. Even though I listen to death, black and other genres of metal music, John's execution scene always makes me cry. (Anyway, I know the thing with metal music may sound really off topic and weird to most people here but that's a thing about the human mind/psychic that I wanted to mention here. You probably know what I mean)ï»¿"

"Well thatÂ´s right, he was famous back then, and it would appear a bit strange. About his innocence, he really first broke that in Training Day. ï»¿"
"Also it would be weird for him to be big because he is famous and everyone would know he has been FXed, with MCD no one else knew that he wasnt that big because he wasnt famousï»¿"
"They actually did just that with David Morse, he is infact bigger than Duncan but they Fxed it, I guess Denzel is a good call after all, although I question if he is innocent enoughï»¿"

"I'm currently reading Stephen King's novel for the third time. I think it's fair to say that he outdid himself with this fantastic novel.

fuckin amazzing movieï»¿
this is like the only movie trailer without tons of spambotsï»¿
this is a great movie. I came accross it by mistake flicking thru tv channells. I loved it and then went and purchased the dvd. Its 3 to 4 hours long. its a great film. Dont skip through parts and try not to spoil it by watching snipetts of this on youtube etc... you will like this as its the same person who made shwashank redemption which I also likedï»¿
"@NCISgirl97 Whether it's good? Yes. I would say anyone who claims this movie to be anything but amazing is either lying, or has no taste in what a good film is.All actors, especially Tom Hanks, are amazing and the story is obviously a great story.It is however a very sad movie and it's quite depressing. So I would advise not watching it when in a sad mood lol. I would actually rate this better than Shawshank, and I love that film.ï»¿"
"in one word: 'awesome' you just need to see this movie, a great movie! duncan acts very good to in this movieï»¿"
