"I know that most of recent movies are involved with the illuminati Freemason Satan hands shit to brainwash all the young to have pure upcoming dirty generation full of dirty sexual and Satanic thoughts and shit like itâ€™s something normal to live with ..  and that fat  pig hero of the movie  is one of them ..for all of those  Who doesnâ€™t know much about the  motherfuckers who works in the shadow controlling the world  and that ugly fat bitch is one of  there puppets like most of Hollywood actors /very disappointing to see such a movie like that showing in theatres like itâ€™s  something normal. (  itâ€™s all part of the plan ..the plan of letâ€™s make the world full of Satanic and dirty shit )   Hollywood community ..  95% of them are Jewish Satanic fucking sick motherfuckers.They know that kids will watch it even  if their parents wonâ€™t allow them for the meantime.ï»¿"

"I am spanish and I love Jim Henson.The muppets show was for adults a bit ironic and sarcastic with a good sense of humour.I know whe are in 2018 but in every way this is too much for my eyes and is not funny at all.Sorry for the young people that they don't know all the values that Henson father leave to us and they are going to discover the puppets world in this film with very rude and nasty words and scenes.I can't believe when he said this is like a secret because he saw his father and Frank Oz improvising many times and never was recording,I don't imagine my idol Jim doing this, he was a gentleman and religous I thought his family was too.

"Alright, I'm going to explain to those who have an open mindset, and those who are willing to hear me out and not become butt-hurt! After 30 years. 30 YEARS of entertaining children. The directors have decided to give it a parental point of view. This movie is for the parents. Cartoons I use to watch when I was younger, had depicted and hidden jokes for the parents. Some cartoons alone were meant for parents. STOP, being so ultimately sensitive and overthink the little things. This film is for the parents, I think they deserve their own little twist. Let alone that my parents grew up watching Muppets. And their hella excited for this film.ï»¿"

Anyone can watch the movie, see if i care.

And write a bad review saying it wasnt family friendlyï»¿
Yea for real my little sis watches Muppet babies on Disney and she's 6 and my mom would not like this movie ruining the show for her.Honestlyï»¿
Me and my brother will just say its regular muppetsï»¿
I would think the word murder in the title would prevent any confusion _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
The Happytime Murders https://bit.ly/2NdHW2Xï»¿
They will then complain that itâ€™s not a kid film despite the 18 certificateï»¿

Dirty Kermit the frogï»¿
"Trying to hard to be funny, gross and wierd in my opinion; I just want Kermit back... :(ï»¿"

I found the teaser on instagram i thought it was a joke at first.ï»¿
Lolï»¿
Boringï»¿

"This isn't ""adult"" humor. It's crude, tasteless, sophomoric garbage.ï»¿"
I hope north Korea nukes us soon.ï»¿
cool its kinda a spin off of when jim henson worked with SNL in the 70s...(how i know this ill never know) but a few characters he made actually had really rude qualities (for muppets)....like one was a stoner hippie and the other was trying to sleep with the othersï»¿
I'm watching this!!!!ï»¿
"Well, it's the original franchise that everyone wanted instead of remakes so you better all go watch this movieï»¿"
This movie is ridiculous.ï»¿
"But... the muppets are supposed to the a staple of happy memories..?N-not this... i'm sorry.ï»¿"
I have several questionsï»¿
Pussy alert in the comment sectionï»¿
I love Melissa McCarthy but this movie is disappointing.ï»¿
+Milo Ewens What if it does well?ï»¿
I have a Theory I think Philip's the Blue Police Puppet is the killer the reason I think he is the killer is becuase I feel like when he was a kid all he ever wanted was a singing voice and to dance but sadly he was bad at both and everyone laughed at him and that made him mad and wanted revenge of every puppet that could sing and dance.ï»¿
Almost crapped my pants watching the preview...definitely a must seeï»¿
askï»¿
Oh God I'm going to see this movieï»¿
"This is going to be the raunchiest, most vulgar and probably worst movie in history! Itâ€™s going to make â€œSausage Partyâ€ù look more like â€œThe Sound Of Musicâ€ù!ï»¿"
So kids can watch This? How retarded r u? Wow.ur dud in the head.ï»¿
+Donna Cabot Under 17 requires an accompanying parent or adult guardian.ï»¿
Who wants to bet that the people who havenâ€™t seen the trailer are going to take there 6 year old kid to see thisï»¿
So basically Avenue Q minus the singing and ~cutesy~ Sesame Street vibes with Sausage Party influencesï»¿
I just watched this trailer with my Dad. I am the most uncomfortable kid on Earthï»¿
"Reminds me of ""Puppets Who Kill"" for some reason.............ï»¿"

"This movies gonna be so fucked upLmaoï»¿"
Jim Hanson is rolling in his grave...ï»¿

This is putridï»¿
Sophie Mowry oof gotta hate that autocorrect! Hilarious *ï»¿
"And some parents will see muppets, but not the rating and take the kid(s) to see this.ï»¿"
This its the muppetsï»¿
"Suck it Sesame Street. You won't win shit. This movie is happening, so there. Why didn't they whine about or threaten to sue Avenue Q or Stuffed & Unstrung? Idiots.ï»¿"
Bet you the plot twist is the killer is a puppet or a puppet killed their mom or dadï»¿

When you watch this film just think to yourself... These were the same people that made the muppet Christmas Carolï»¿
Everything's fine and dandy until you wonder What Jim Henson would thinkï»¿
This is newest version of Avenue Q but itâ€™s not a musicalï»¿
"Mr. Mcwaffels101 of course itâ€™s a musical the main song is â€œHere I go, here I go, here I go.â€ùï»¿"
"Boo, It was done better 30 years ago when it was called Meet the Feebles...ï»¿"

I'm surprised that the general consensus isn't that this looks fucking awful. Just watch Who Framed Rodger Rabbit if you're hankering for this style of thing.ï»¿
Hollywood is running out of ideasï»¿
this looks fucking stupidï»¿
"Oh boy! This looks like a funny movie to enjoy... I wonder how many ""loving mothers"" that ""never swears in front of children"" are going to take their kids to see this movie and complain about how it's inappropriate for kids to watch despite what the trailer just shown?ï»¿"
who wants to guess if they will put refrences from the originalsï»¿

Wtf! I gotta see this.ï»¿
Longest money shot everï»¿
Yes so much yes Kermit better fuck somebody upï»¿
They had me at Muppets.ï»¿
Hear that?? That's the sound of Jim Henson rolling over in his grave. I'd go watch this just to see how many parents make the mistake of taking their kids to see this. Lol.ï»¿
"I've never seen a muppets movie cauce i always thought the human actor element were to cheesy and the plot were silly,,,but this I'll definitely watch, it's about time for these caddyass muppets to go adultï»¿"
"wow deadpool would fit right in this movie, omg its so bad hahahaha kind of reminds me of roger rabbit but R rated. we could really use another  roger rabbit like show and better R ratedï»¿"
34 seconds in and I've already decided that I WILL be seeing this movie.ï»¿
"Is this real?I hope so!ï»¿"

Did they just put avenue Q in a movieï»¿
why better than the Muppetsï»¿
"""For 50 cents I'll suck your dick""ï»¿"
What a way to ruin Sesame Street and The Muppets for me >:(ï»¿
Wow this is a Blatant ripoff of the movie The Fuzzï»¿
There was a movie made like this from IFC like 6 years agoï»¿
"Wow. All I can say is Avenue Q handled this stuff better. Everybody just go see that, get the soundtrack. Henson was all for experimenting with the maturity of puppetry, but even he would be slapping forehead in frustration at this. There's no wit or charm here. It's the problem with a lot of modern comedy; everyone is looking to 'push the bar', but when a creator has literally no self-imposed restraints, the whole project suffers because it's just aimlessly taking shots at... Nothing.ï»¿"
Stanley!!!!!!!!!! _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
HAHA I ALREADY LOVE THIS MOVIEï»¿
Jim Handson didn't want this tbhï»¿
Who the fuck is Jim Handson LMFAOï»¿
"Dixon Cider Yep I can tell you don't have a childhood, and you never did since you were born mentally retardedJim Handson is the original creator of The muppets and sesame street and other muppet related things.ï»¿"

"Dr. Keel Whitey YOU JUST GOT ROASTED, And flipboy crea5ions , come on give appreciation to the person who made the roastï»¿"
when does it come out tho??ï»¿
I can't wait!  This looks hysterical.  I love Melissa McCarthy.  Adding the dirty muppets and OMG...this is going to the funniest movie in years!ï»¿
"I have so many mixed emotions yet I want to see this! I thought this was an SNL fake trailer but I was purely shocked when I found out that it was real. Tbh I got a ""Smile Time"" from the series Angel vibe from this. Puppets who curse and do terrible things. I am pretty pumped for this _Ÿ˜‚ though that last part made me just stare at my screen with bulged eyes. Why?!ï»¿"
this looks awesome hahaï»¿
Your disgusting!!!!!ï»¿
"Emily Bailey and you are pathetic. If you only like jokes for kids, piss off.ï»¿"

"Let me guess here, the killer is either a puppet or a puppet/human hybridï»¿"
WTFï»¿
Just... WHAT?ï»¿
that is fuckin GREAT!ï»¿
The fuckï»¿
This looks stupid.....but I need to see it!ï»¿
Who the hell thinks Melissa McCarthy is funny? Is she just really cheap? Like what the hell.ï»¿
My childhood is ruined... AND THIS LOOKS AMAZING AND FUNNY AF!!!ï»¿
"I'm assuming that most of you complaining have never heard of Avenue Q?Why would Jim Henson be turning over in his grave? He didn't create puppets, peons, only Muppets.ï»¿"
"Because even though he did add slight adult humor, Jim Henson was never that explicit. His son Brian is directing this movie and it's being made by the Jim Henson Company. This movie is ruining people's childhoods and I don't think Jim would like that.ï»¿"
"@jane sellsers, who the fuck cares. its a movie for adults.ï»¿"
I can tell by your language that the reputation of The Jim Henson Company originally founded by Jim Henson which was to give respectable viewing to families. (i.e children and their families) is of no importance to you.ï»¿
"I am a man reared on the magic and wonder weaved by the masters, Geisel, Henson, and Rogers. But, as a reasonable adult, I can tell the difference between educational programming and adult satire.ï»¿"
"To me Jim Henson founded his company on giving children and adults good humor plus educational benefits with all of his productions. This adult ""muppet"" movie just seems very inappropriate from what his company has always done in the past. And that to me, is so different from what the Muppets have always been projected to be.ï»¿"
"Yes, it is different. But different doesn't mean wrong. You've actively called out the writers, directors, and producers, by saying ""This movie is ruining peoples childhood"". No, Ma'am, adulthood ruined my childhood. This movie is satirical, and if you're trying to take more from it than that, you want there to be an issue solely to justify your hurt feelings at the fact that you have aged, and the world has aged with you.ï»¿"
"Avenue Q contained adult humor and situations but everything served the story without being crude for crude sake.  While it's difficult to judge an entire movie by its trailer, what is presented here looks gratuitously crude.  There were also many laughs in Avenue Q and I personally found nothing funny in the trailer for this movie.  But, different strokes for different folks.  The appeal of this movie is not universal.ï»¿"
jane sellers the creator of the muppets doesnt own rights to puppet movies. Just because this is a puppet movie doesnt mean it has anything to do with the fucking muppets. I dont give a fuck how special or how popular they were. They dont own the rights to puppet movies. Just because they have puppets doesnt mean its a muppets rip off. Get your head out of your ass.ï»¿
Avenue Q was thought out. This is disturbing as fuck.ï»¿
I grew up watching the Muppets and this is in no way gonna ruin my childhood. It looks hillarious. My childhood was ruined by getting old and having to work 50 hrs a week. I want my funny s@#t.ï»¿
Fuck yea cuntï»¿
What the actual FUCK did i just see?? I used to love Melissa but u got no respect from me for this garbageï»¿
"Iâ€™m light headed, Iâ€™m light headed... _Ÿ’€_Ÿ’€_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿"
LOL! I have to see this.ï»¿
"This is absolute garbage. Children will push to see it because they have an association with the muppets being fun.Idiot parents will let their children watch it because they donâ€™t know or donâ€™t care.Why anyone in their right mind would want to watch this is beyond me.Itâ€™s not comedy, comedy requires thought and intellect, this is nothing but pure filth.End times are coming and god will not look favourably upon this. Please wake up sheeple - rise up and donâ€™t accept this form of â€œentertainmentâ€ù, look around you and recognise weâ€™re all being pushed toward degeneracy.ï»¿"
Lol lighten upï»¿
"Dude. Go take your head out of your righteous, crazy ass and stop looking up stuff you know you don't find funny. Also, comedy only needs a shared experiences and social groups. Don't write about ""intellect"" while being a moron.ï»¿"
We are going make this movie with puppets.... why? Because everyone loves puppets! (Rupaulâ€™s voice)ï»¿
"This looks really disappointing...this isn't exactly anything new. It's lacking to engage its audience in a well thought out and clever way, strip away the puppets and it's just a regular cop/agent duo trope that's been done so many times. Yes, the puppets look great and it has well known actors but it's just using basic shock/dark humor to capture the attention of a general audience and make money in a very easy way.I don't think many people would own, rewatch or remember this movie in the next 5-10 years which really sucks because I felt like maybe this could have been a lot better if it was maybe given more thought and time to be  written. But, that's just my opinion, if you love this movie then don't let a person on the internet stop you from enjoying it :)ï»¿"
"It is probably a rip off of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"".ï»¿"
"Bro. This looks funny, lol. I'd watch thisï»¿"
"Same idea as Avenue Q, but looks like poor execution.ï»¿"
Omg I gotta go see this!!ï»¿
"everyone: sausage partyme singing: oN AVENUE Q~ï»¿"
sameï»¿

Fuck yeahï»¿
Definitely a must see on my list.....ï»¿
"this is giving meÂ a Mix of Muppets Meets Watchmen Meets Scary Movie, I want to see it!!ï»¿"
People already saw the Muppets like this and this movie won't help _Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
"This kinda looks like a sausage party situation were all it is Is just something that looks kid friendly doing adult ""comedy,"" hopefully the movie is actually good and funny thoughï»¿"
I will never look at silly string the same way again.ï»¿
"They had me at ""ruptured hymen"" LMAO _Ÿ˜‚ï»¿"
Ah yes... the standards of audiences keep rising.  What a bunch of trash.  There was nothing remotely funny about any of that... how predictable was that last scene?ï»¿
"Boy this is just who framed Roger rabbit, but rated R and with puppets nothing specialï»¿"
This reminds me of Avenue Qï»¿
Sausage party but Muppets versionï»¿
Oh my god.ï»¿
Melissa mcarthy Is not funny. that is allï»¿
Oh my gah!ï»¿
"Comedy, Kids, Family and Animated Film WHAAAAT???ï»¿"
The last scene is lost footage of me _Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
Who framed roger rabbit?ï»¿
"This isn't trending and it's got alota Haters? I see why entertainment is so boring nowadays people are to fucking sensitive it's a comedy no it's not a movie for kids neither was sausage party, and in all honesty if you blindly took your kids to a movie without watching a trailer or researching it first your pretty dumb to begin with. It's like we live in a backwards world where people only accept offensive material when it's purposely hateful or negatively charged.ï»¿"
"Me: idk, seems like it might not be so good..Puppet: gets punched in the face after offering a bjMe: okay, well MAYBE...Ok no the only reason i wanna give it a chance is because i love puppets and i love when people take childish things and make them mature, its just amusing so hopefully this'll be good _Ÿ_”ï»¿"
AHAHAHAHAHA IDC What you all think. I think it's hilarious and the last part is GOLD. _Ÿ‘Œ_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
Im not mad lmao. I love this _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
I want to not watch it but I kind of have to... For scienceï»¿
Childhood ruined _Ÿ˜£_Ÿ˜£ï»¿
"Actually what would be funny IS a satire on sesame st, R rated Big Bird and Bert and Ernie. The Count would be the most devilish.ï»¿"
Is this real?ï»¿
I'll watch this for Mellisa.ï»¿
"let me guess, Mellissa McCarthy hurts herself and breathes hard during one of these scenesï»¿"
Awesome.ï»¿
I pray beyond prayers no child sees this._Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
It's a good idea but the jokes are pretty childish and staleï»¿
Wtfï»¿
My eyes my eyesï»¿
:/ï»¿
Who framed roger rabbit?ï»¿
This is so sadï»¿
I'm gonna be watching this one for sure almost p!$$ed myself laughing watching this trailerï»¿
When does it come outï»¿
This is the closest we'll get to an Avenue Q movieï»¿
That cumming part was funny but I was surprised he was an A1 nigga _Ÿ™„ï»¿
I don't know whether to be offended or entertained. One minute I wanna laugh and the next I feel annoyed. Partly because I grew up on the muppets and you just don't associate children things with adult things. You know? Bloody hell I don't even know if I even make sense but... LOL! I've got to see this movie! :Pï»¿
That was disturbingï»¿
OMG!! this looks so hilarious!! Love the FBI scene...FBI stands for Fucking Big Idiot...!! _Ÿ_£ï»¿
"Who framed roger rabbit, with puppetsï»¿"
If this is anything like Sausage party (which it seems like it is) I'll pass and just wait for it at redbox. Sausage party was so disappointing on so many levels.ï»¿
"Wow, Avenue Q the movie looks great guys!ï»¿"
this is just Bright but even worse holy shitï»¿
All we need now is the feebles.ï»¿
WHAAAATTT THEEEE FUCCCCCKï»¿

I'll stick to Roger Rabbitï»¿
"You know, itâ€™s interesting to see that the two cops get along. After all, thatâ€™s one of the big cliches in these movies. Then again, I suppose thatâ€™s the point, as the source of comedy in this movie comes from... elsewhereï»¿"
Wheres Kermit?ï»¿
I donâ€™t know how I feel about thisï»¿
"Not Original! ""Meet the Freebles"".. Nuff saidï»¿"
Sorry... Freebles. PETER JACKSON!!!ï»¿

Someone must be drunkï»¿
Funny as hell._Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ‘Œï»¿
This looks pure gold. XDï»¿
Uhhhh the blue puppet looks like Flabber from beetleborgs.ï»¿

The end of this trailer made me laughï»¿
So sort of like meet the feebles then only without the edge...ï»¿
"I laughed a little, but the ending...thereâ€™s pushing the envelope and there shoving it in your damn throats. I donâ€™t man I donâ€™t have faith in this thing being successful.ï»¿"
Shoving it in our throats? Dang! You mean they're forcing people to watch?ï»¿

_Ÿ˜µ_Ÿ˜µ_Ÿ˜µ_Ÿ˜µï»¿
This is the movie I need to seeï»¿
This looks like the bestthing ever madeï»¿
That was cute.ï»¿
"I really like the concept but i'm not really sure about the execution or even the tone it took (especially because of the last scene) ! Also, i'm not gonna lie, i'm not a huge fan of Melissa McCarthy's humor and i can help but feel that it might have be a better film with someone else in the lead (Andy Sandberg, maybe). More importantly, I feel like this concept has a lot of potential for comedy, story telling and even social commentary. This feel like a funny rent but overall something very forgettable. Then again, the movie not out so yet who knows but that's honestly how i feel about it. Perhaps, if they attempt a slightly more ""mature"" version of Who frame Roger Rabbit or something in the vein of Bright instead of literally going for the ""it's funny cause it's puppets guys"" route, i would have more hope for this. Oh well... we'll have to wait and see.ï»¿"
"why isn't this rated? kids are gonna go see this because there's stupid puppets in it,  its not even a funny movie, Hollywood Pedophiles! sickening!!ï»¿"
"Jim sons is behind this ! You a spiting on your fathers legacy young man. How dare you! Im all for new ideas but taking something a man spent his life building poring his heart and sole into for you to come along and reck it in one swoop! For shame.ï»¿"

"Peter Jackson already did an adult muppet movie with Meet the Feebles. That was rubbish but was still a lot better than this looks. Also, I don't know if its just bad scripts, but Melissa McCarthy movies aren't funny.ï»¿"
"sighCouldn't we have gotten Avenue Q the movie instead?ï»¿"
How is this categorized as kids?ï»¿

OMG MELISSA MCCARTHY YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSï»¿
"_Ÿ”´ THE HAPPYTIME MURDERS | 2018 FULL~HD â˜› [ shot.la/mOPEJ ]When the puppet cast of an '80s children's TV show begins to get murdered one by one, a disgraced LAPD detective-turned-private eye puppet takes on the case.ï»¿"
Yup I'm gonna watch this.ï»¿
So itâ€™s Meet the Feebles crosses with Hot Fuzz. Iâ€™m down with thatï»¿
Wtf is wrong with the world? this is considered comedy?ï»¿
Well it's good to see how unfunny breaking the cardinal rule things like the muppets have where you're not supposed to have them acknowledged as different to humans.ï»¿
Iove it but really Melissa McCarthyâ€™s really fuck I hate that fat bitch sheâ€™s not even funny why not Sam l Jackson or Johnny depp or even Jim carry ???ï»¿
"I don't know, the premise is interesting but I am not really crazy about Melissa McCarthy.ï»¿"
Fucked up_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ there goes my childhood.ï»¿
You want some Rotten cotton lolï»¿
why didn't they just make an Avenue Q movie instead?ï»¿
Mild engineering questionnaire convict pan picture generally visit well before English.ï»¿
What the....this is faaaaar from the Henson witticism I'm familiar with.  I honestly prefer The Muppets show that was staged to look like The Office. This is just adult fart jokes. Disappointed.ï»¿
This seems like a ripoff of the smile time episode of angel. But thatâ€™s a good thing. Looks goodï»¿
So... Who Framed Roger Rabbit 2018?ï»¿
yesï»¿
"Probably the most childish, idiotic movie trailer I have ever seen.ï»¿"
WHATï»¿
"Ugh, can't stand Melissa McCarthy!ï»¿"
Looks like a poorly done sequal to meet the feabals. Peter Jackson did the crap when he was nobody what's her excuse list a bet?ï»¿
Looks like theyâ€™ve tried too hard to make it funny. Not sure what I think of it from the advert alone.ï»¿
"So they couldn't get the rights to do a film of Avenue Q, I guess?ï»¿"
Three words - MEET THE FEEBLES. Directed by Oscar winner Peter Jackson.ï»¿
Is my childhood ruined?ï»¿
Why does it have to be Melissa McCarthy? I find her so darn unfunny! They could have gone for Kristen Wiig or so many other great choices.ï»¿
All the Greg the Bunny characters need to have a cameo somewhere in this movie.ï»¿
I like Melissa but this honestly looks as funny as a burning orphanage.ï»¿
imfpredicts so do the rest of her movies.ï»¿
"imfpredicts now hold on, compared to most female comedians, shes funny. but only as long as she stays cute and chubby.ï»¿"
Thats funny tooï»¿
So you mean it's hilariousï»¿
Zo Brown well ya I agree but this movie looks so badï»¿
Your disgusting!!!!!ï»¿
so.......downright fucking hilarious?ï»¿
Dang.ï»¿
Emily Bailey Shut the fuck up.ï»¿
"imfpredicts I guess I don't understand why people love her so much. Like it seems every movie she's in you have many people saying ""Melissa's great but this movie and the writing are terrible"" . I mean she's got all this respect as supposedly one of the best comedic actors, and yet she's always in the worst movies. There's a lot of better comedic actors out there who don't have near the fame and esteem she does. I don't get it.For real though this movie looks awful. Usually the trailer compiles the best jokes from a movie, and this trailer was just a series of hardcore cringe garbage jokes. Written by teenagers.ï»¿"
Funny afï»¿
Ludwig Hazlitt its hollywood all actors care about is their love for.trump and and their love.for moneyï»¿
So it looks hilarious??ï»¿
The Muppet's with Melissa McCartneyï»¿
"This looks real bad, and not the good kind of real bad.ï»¿"
Maybe they should have called Matt Stone and Trey Parker for advice. They made puppets funny. This is cheap.ï»¿
It's a good raunchy comedy if you feel dirty after watching the trailerï»¿
"Okay, so I like the IDEA of this movie, but...judging from the trailer, they just took every single scene and twisted it to make as many naughty jokes as possible.  Not even good jokes, just gross ones to play off the satisfaction of watching something destroy something from your childhood.  I mean, I like a good dick joke, but at least make it funny.  This one's a miss.ï»¿"
TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm so excited _Ÿ˜Å_Ÿ˜Å_Ÿ˜Åï»¿
"just when you think the dumb white cunts couldnt get any dumber, they find a way.ï»¿"

Who Killed Roger Rabbit...muppet style.ï»¿
ITS THE FBI GUY TO BE HONEST I GOT THIS FROM SCOOBY DOO MOVIES GAMES AND CARTOONS OF ALL MYSTERYIS CHARACTERS?ï»¿
Was fine and funny until the last 20 secondsï»¿
Oh my god...wtfï»¿
Sheâ€™s better than this crapï»¿
Omg what is this lol!ï»¿
This is such a ripoff of Puppet Cop by SteveGreeneComedyï»¿
Sesame street must be sooooo happy the muppets arent in their show anymore xDDï»¿
the only muppet movie ill ever seeï»¿
it'll be funny if Kermit was the killerï»¿
That office scene though _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜_-remind anybody else of Crank Yankers? _Ÿ˜_ï»¿
"A lame version of Peter Jackson's ""Meet the Feebles"".ï»¿"
Whatâ€™s so funny about a puppet ejaculating? It wouldnâ€™t be funny if a human did it in a movie so why would it be with a puppet? I guess the idea of Brian Henson doing an anti Sesame Street movie sounds cool but wasnâ€™t that already done with Avenue Q?ï»¿
who framed roger rabbit but with muppets and the humor of sausage party...niceï»¿
"This is so stupid, I'm watching it.ï»¿"
I showed my mum this and she goes what shitty peice of trash I love the Muppets they destroy  them and this bad lazy humour like Adam Sandler movies but worse.ï»¿
All y'all triggered _Ÿ˜‚ï»¿

.... whaa.... What did I just watch ? ..... I.... huh??ï»¿
Wow...Jim Henson would be so disappointed. Way to be a jerk and spit on his legacy you perverted rejects.ï»¿
I love Avenue Qï»¿
Anyone remember that show Greg the Bunny I think it was called.ï»¿
Yupï»¿
what a croc oh shiteï»¿
"Much like Stuffed and Unstrung, Avenue Q, etc, it wasn't made for your kids. Take them to see one of the other MILLION movies aimed at them. And do some research about your completely wrong opinions on Henson and muppets. Also, fuck off with your Melissa hate, too. This movie looks hilarious. Not everything was made for you...ï»¿"
...jesusâ€_.ï»¿
Seems like they stole the idea from The Fuzzï»¿
"Yeeahhhhhhh, nope.ï»¿"
Decent concept but. Hell no.ï»¿
"this is such a class idea, i just donâ€™t think this movie will do it justice, unless the actual movie has some great jokes in it, itâ€™s looking pretty mehï»¿"
Brilliant so differentï»¿
Yes...ï»¿
Wow. American films have hit rock bottom....smhï»¿

Yesï»¿
Tropical fox your not the only oneï»¿
Most likely.ï»¿
I like the end sceneï»¿
NOPEï»¿
All we need know is  a squeal or a spin off of who framed roger rabbit!ï»¿
Looks pretty damn good & hilarious. I shall see it...ï»¿
Muppets adult party movieï»¿
"So...Who Framed Roger Rabbit? But with puppets? That's what this is, lol.ï»¿"
"This is the worst thing Iâ€™ve seen, and Iâ€™ve seen the White Walkers.ï»¿"
"My childhood... It's... It's... Finally making senseï»¿"
Fucking trash!ï»¿
Epic!!ï»¿
Looks like shit honestly.ï»¿
why does it say that this is appropriate for all audiences in the beginning?ï»¿
"Soooo many in life with soooo much to complain about or looking to pickup a torch to carry,Jim Henson rolling over in his grave really?Give it a rest folks it's not supposed to be for the kids as per the obvious disclaimer what happens when kids aren't around.But back to the Jim Henson topic, what makes you think he didn't have a perverse idea of his puppets?Or is it possible you feel rotten cotton isnt funny?I'm from the Muppet show era,and in no way offended.But I'm betting if you saw the Dave Chapelle show then you've seen Knee-high park skit,funny as hell.Ease up on being PC,and trying to shame people who don't fit what you feel is right.Very arrogant to assume HENSON didn't have this vision of Muppets,just because he didn't do it don't mean it didn't cross his mind,just the culture during his time wouldn't have it.Look at the shows from the Muppet show era,think All in the family by title was a wholesome show about family? Hugely controversial at the time and just as successful,but in today's culture puhlenty of you that think Henson rolling in his grave over this movie,All in the family would never make it past the pilot stage.Ease up people take a breath of FRESH AIR and exhale Slowly.ï»¿"
Melissa McCarthy is the new Pauly Shore.ï»¿
wow people are actually liking this...ï»¿
That's wrong in so many waysï»¿
Omgï»¿
I hate this crap!  They make it look appealing to kids but  not  for  kids while being unappealing  for adults yet only suitable  for adults.ï»¿
Greg The Bunny already did this 10 years ago and 10 times better.ï»¿
Wtf did I just watch_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
"This is what I hate about society. You botards complain because the Muppets are to kid friendly so btw Jim Hensons son Brian Henson dumbass's is the one making it. If anything Jim Henson would approve of this cause it keeps with u babies throwing fits about the Muppets not being dark or cynical enough. Just proof that ignorance and retardation is running rampant in the USA. U complain Muppets, which were created for adults while sasame street was for kids, isn't up to our times and when they finally hit it on the head u bitch cause it looks like shit. Well Peter Jackson who fucked up lotr, and made king kong look like shit did a shitty job with meet the feebles, Greg the Bunny was an amazing and unappreciated show even when moved Fox to IFC. Grow the hell up and stop eating tide pods u cry baby dickbags. Oh and just a fyi for u ignorant douches that consider yourselves knowledgeable about everything. Jim Henson tried for years to get a movie like this made but was constantly rejected because it was considered to much back then. It was only after his death may he rest in peace that the piece of shit movie meet the feebles was made by the worst director in history Peter Jackson, who for all u Jackson dick riders out there, said that after he made the first LOTR movie he threw in the towel and just didn't care about the others. So stop with ur ""this has been done before"" b.s. because if u idiots stop and think every movie out there has been done a hundred times over. Seriously pull ur heads out ur asses and aim higher then a G.E.D. cause if u knew anything u would see how appropriate a time it is for this movie to be here. Learn ur shit before u run ur mouth, not everything stays all puffy clouds and unicorn rainbow piss. Funny how the majority love this trailer and the rest of u just cry like a bunch of cock hounds.ï»¿"

Theaters aren't idiots they are going to be on the alert informing people what kind of movie it is if they see people with kids with them asking for tickets to see itï»¿
That is really on the parents' own heads. The title of the movie should be enough of a red flag for even the most obtuse of parents (just like sausage party's title should have done). We shouldn't be deniedÂ content because people can't use common sense.ï»¿

"William Colwell btw it's 'coarsening', n its not on kids what they r watching, or that parents don't care- media is everwhere n all schools n homes have tablets, computers, allow cell phones, gamers etc whatever- it's the average now man- in other words parents can't even block half that shit--  btw the movie looks hilariousï»¿"

"Yeah, but it was however done as a clever tribute and ""tip of the hat"" to the muppets by Whedon and co, it wasn't meant as; adult level styled comedy with swearing and sexual humor though.ï»¿"
That's the whole point smh clearly you don't get it _Ÿ˜…_Ÿ˜Œï»¿
"Go troll somebody junior and take your emoji's i can't even see with you, i get it you just don't. Everything needs to be some adult take with a muppets spoof on TV or film? Sure kid, (rolls eyes) sure they all do, lol.ï»¿"
Jim Henson rolling in his grave from this one !ï»¿
"Brian Bagnall This is what I hate about society. You botards complain because the Muppets are to kid friendly so btw Jim Hensons son Brian Henson dumbass's is the one making it. If anything Jim Henson would approve of this cause it keeps with u babies throwing fits about the Muppets not being dark or cynical enough. Just proof that ignorance and retardation is running rampant in the USA. U complain Muppets, which were created for adults while sasame street was for kids, isn't up to our times and when they finally hit it on the head u bitch cause it looks like shit. Well Peter Jackson who fucked up lotr, and made king kong look like shit did a shitty job with meet the feebles, Greg the Bunny was an amazing and unappreciated show even when moved Fox to IFC. Grow the hell up and stop eating tide pods u cry baby dickbags. Oh and just a fyi for u ignorant douches that consider yourselves knowledgeable about everything. Jim Henson tried for years to get a movie like this made but was constantly rejected because it was considered to much back then. It was only after his death may he rest in peace that the piece of shit movie meet the feebles was made by the worst director in history Peter Jackson, who for all u Jackson dick riders out there, said that after he made the first LOTR movie he threw in the towel and just didn't care about the others. So stop with ur ""this has been done before"" b.s. because if u idiots stop and think every movie out there has been done a hundred times over. Seriously pull ur heads out ur asses and aim higher then a G.E.D. cause if u knew anything u would see how appropriate a time it is for this movie to be here. Learn ur shit before u run ur mouth, not everything stays all puffy clouds and unicorn rainbow piss. Funny how the majority love this trailer and the rest of u just cry like a bunch of cock hounds.ï»¿"
"Considering Brian Henson is the producer for the film, the chairman of The Jim Henson Company and his son as well, I highly doubt it.ï»¿"

Dickum N Lickum the V: Emperor Of YouTube. They also haven't heard of Meet the Feebles.ï»¿
His son is literally directing the film and the Jim Henson Company is producing it.ï»¿
"I'll never understand! Hollywood . Jim Henson  had a grander visions for his creations and created them to be something truly magical . Remember under Jim Henson's masterful direction they made the masterpiece  ""The Dark Crystal""  and some some odd reason they could not get the sequel approved ; yet somehow this perversion of did .ï»¿"
They've even got the voice actor for the puppet Sal doing the voice of the cop puppet. -_-ï»¿

"hayjwhin Jim wasnâ€™t a stranger to dark, creepy elements. Are you not aware of The Never Ending Story? The Dark Crystal? Labyrinth? While those werenâ€™t raunchy, they were still dark and creepy and freakin traumatizing lol not to mention this movie is directed by HIS OWN SON BRIAN!ï»¿"
emrys I'll concede that point. This is worse.ï»¿
Maddi The Misfit dark and creepy yes but this is vile for the sake of vile. It has no point. Jim would be spining in his graveï»¿
Get over yourself. I'm so fucking sorry that something simply existing can make you so upset.ï»¿
"emrys In fact, this might kill the company.ï»¿"
I agree - this doesnâ€™t even look funny and itâ€™s just weird having sexualized puppets.ï»¿
"Don't embarrass yourself, idiot. You're obviously not a true fan of Jim Henson. Real fans know that Henson originally WANTED to have his puppets be used for adult themes, but because he let Sesame Street use them, he and his puppets were then always associated with being for children. This movie has the type of humor and situations he was never able to incorporate the Muppets in. This is only a ""dump"" on his legacy to the ignorant people who really only like the Muppets, not Jim Henson.ï»¿"
"So 2:01 is ok?That's what I thoughtï»¿"
"For a fucking rated R movie with *PUPPETS*? YES, IT'S OKAY, DUMBASS. They did similar shit in the first Scary Movie, which was ALSO an R-rated film.ï»¿"
"Yeah, exactly, you fucking idiot. Keep your mouth shut about what you don't know. You're not a true fan of Jim Henson if you actually thought Jim Henson's vision was to be an entertainer for kids.ï»¿"
"hayjwhin I know, right? True, he was involved in rather messed-up movies like ""The Dark Crystal"", ""The Witches"", and ""Labyrinth"" (which still looks awesome, btw, I don't care what anyone says or thinks), but they were never dirty, inappropriate, coarse, violent, or even that gross!!

Can you hear that....its the sound of Jim Henson spinning in his grave! We've hit an all time Low now.ï»¿
"Wrong, dumbass. He wouldn't be ""spinning"" in his grave. His original intent for his puppets was to have them being depicted in adult themes, not child-friendly content. The Muppets TV shows and movies were only geared toward children because he made the mistake of letting Sesame Street use them.ï»¿"
If Jim Henson was here he would be very pissed about this movieï»¿
"No, he wouldn't be pissed, you fucking moron. You're obviously only a fan of the Muppets, not Jim Henson himself. He hated the fact that he was only seen as a childrens' entertainer. He WANTED to tell stories geared more toward adults using his puppets.ï»¿"

I watched all of the Austin powers movies when they came out and I'm 23 now so you can do the math there.

Jim Henson is going to come back from the dead and kill the EVERYONE involved with this movie.ï»¿
"Actually, he was an advocate for adult oriented humor, and the original Muppet Show was suppose to be more adult oriented before the network said no to the idea.ï»¿"
You beat me on that one.ï»¿
That would include his son.ï»¿
His Son is the Directorï»¿
LOLï»¿
"Considering that his son has been trying to get this made for years, you couldnâ€™t be more wrong. Henson wasnâ€™t against adult humor. In fact in the early years of SNL The Muppets made regular appearances. Hensonâ€™s early versions of the characters used to make appearances on late night talk shows.ï»¿"
"Actually, he was an advocate for adult oriented humor, and the original Muppet Show was suppose to be more adult oriented before the network said no to the idea.Thats true, however if he wee to come back from the dead i'm pretty sure Henson wouldn't like the execution of this movie! There's no subtly here or clever witticisms to be had here, its too in your face and obvious with all the adult cursing and sexual references. Henson did come from the generation of clever fore-playing and building a story around not being so obvious with your characters! While Jim Henson might've also wanted to have a more adult Muppets i can't imagine something like this would be the end result though. Henson's primetime family oriented Muppet show is a prime example of brilliant execution done right of something you think wouldn't work but does, THIS ISN'T HOWEVER!ï»¿"
Now that would be the movie to watch !ï»¿

Explode the puppets. This goes back all the way to when he was making coffee commercials in black-and-white. You might want to pretend that Jim wouldn't have found this extreme puppet humor hilarious, but Jim's son knows better.ï»¿"
"I think you're all wrong. Yes, Henson was an ""advocate"" for adult humor- meaning satire and the like, not juvenilia like this. This is some Seth Green level Adult Swim shit for stoner bros. Jim Henson would not have approved.ï»¿"

Alex Phillips yep and it was a great movie this one looks shitty cause of McCarthyï»¿
Itâ€™s about time!ï»¿
I thought it was about muppet murder?ï»¿
"OMG yes! I can't wait for the parents who bring their kids to this movie thinking that it is a kid friendly Muppet movie. It's why I went to Deadpool three times, not to watch the movie, but to see the look on parents faces when they realized they made a mistake.ï»¿"
Jeff Garcia you're just a regular edgelord aren't you?ï»¿

"Dude, it has the word ""murders"" in the title, think it's pretty obvious.ï»¿"
If they donâ€™t read the title theyâ€™ll be surprisedï»¿
"Atari Dad All I'm saying it that Deadpool has the word ""Dead"" in his name and still people brought their kids.ï»¿"
Me tooï»¿
It blows my mind when parents do that. How do you not look at the rating before you take your child to something?ï»¿
"No people dont read or watch trailers ....EVER. Long ago a coworker was PISSED OFF cause he took his nephew to see ""Wag The Dog"" thinking it was a kids movie SIMPLY BY THE TITLE. And got pissed cause they wouldnt refund his money. Counter guy said same thing ""Didnt you watch a preview or read what its about?"" lolï»¿"

"It will happen, guaranteed.  CNN will gleefully run with stories, and people like us will comment on the whole crazy thing.ï»¿"
"this is reddit material/iamverybadassï»¿"
Well.. 'Murder' in the title and it been  'R' rated will be a great clue to the parents. _Ÿ™èï»¿
Did u really see parents with there kids  there ? The movie is rated  R lolï»¿
Frank Boccia Sadly yesï»¿
Jeff Garcia this is why I would watch trailers first?ï»¿
Thatâ€™s what happened when I saw Sausage Partyï»¿
"Jeff Garcia i saw children at sausage party, they were there for only 20 seconds before their parents angrily took them out. so i bet this will happen.ï»¿"
Love your sense of humor!  I would've been allowed to see this as a kid & would've laughed my ass off! _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
hahah this happened when i went to the movies with my friend and his mom to see 'scary movie' back in the 6th grade. she made us leave.ï»¿
i did that for sausage part. XDDDDï»¿
Some people just wanna watch the world burnï»¿
How many faces like that have ya seen?ï»¿
Exoshock yes. Yes I do. People are stupidï»¿
"You don't have many healthy relationships in your life, do you? Parents didn't care much for you? That's rough. Sorry, pal. Hang in there.ï»¿"
You need help dudeï»¿
"Haha, I did something similar when Brokeback Mountain came out. Was with my girlfriend at the time (now ex), and we went to the theatre and saw that Brokeback Mountain was playing. She asked what it was about.  Keeping a straight face, I said I think it's a western.  So we went to see it.  When the ""tent scene"" happened, the entire theatre was absolutely quiet, and she goes really loudly ""OH MY GAWD!""  That right there was worth the price of admission. :Pï»¿"
"Dude Iâ€™m the same. Second time I saw it was just for the dipshit parents who donâ€™t know deadpool is another word for tontine and didnâ€™t google the trailer so they missed the 4 fucks, 1 shit, and 1 dick said in the trailerï»¿"
lolï»¿
"Let me say, this looks like Sausage Party done right. Sausage Party done right!ï»¿"
"SORRY, BUT NOTHING BEATS THE DISSAPOINTMENT OF ANYTHING BY STAR WARS, I SAW PEOPLE WALK OUT OF EPISODE 8, EPISODE 7 WAS PASSABLE BY COMPARISON.ï»¿"
Don't they have to know the title to get tickets?ï»¿
Jeff Garcia how old r u?ï»¿
"Jeff Garcia Don't forget Sausage Partyï»¿"
"Same thing happen to a friend of mine, he also went and saw Deadpool and there was a family that brought their kid with them to see it too. I was like ""Who the hell would bring their kid to see rated R move!?!?!?!?""ï»¿"
"Looks really dull, derivative and not really funny. Yeah, if you've never seen Peter Jackson's Meet the Feebles and think Keith Lemon is a comic genius then you may well enjoy it but even with Melissa McCarthy I'm just not sold at all. It's a real shame as I loved McCarthy us The Heat, Spy, Identity Thief and even Ghostbusters but this trailer is altogether embarrassing to watch and feels like it's trying way way way too hard. As I mentioned Meet the Feebles did all this years ago and is far superior to dross like this. Go and watch that instead ...ï»¿"
None For All What the hell?ï»¿
Except meet the feebles was on acidï»¿
Was searching the comments for a Meet the Feebles reference. Did not disappoint.ï»¿

Melissa is fire! _Ÿ”¥ï»¿
cant wait to see melissa and amy schumer do a buddy cop movie next.   come on do 48 hours next.ï»¿
Hollywood is officially out of ideas this looks turrible lolï»¿
Oh....my....God...!!!!!! Definitely NOT for kids. How are they going to keep parents from taking their 4 year old to see this one. I laughed my head off.ï»¿
"Well, it's Rated R, so that will probably be a good deterrent.ï»¿"
"Right, let's hope it is! lolï»¿"
Do parents usually take their 4-year olds to movies without knowing its rating and watching a preview?ï»¿
"Actually yes, I saw a woman and her 4 year old in the first Iron Man movie, which was really violentï»¿"

"Garland5 Maybe they'll see the word ""murders"" in the title.ï»¿"
That doesn't mean she didn't know its rating or see a preview. She may have just decided it was fine for her child to watchï»¿
"Patrick Bohn - Yes. Parents took their kids to see Sausage Party in droves, and many of them then had the gall to complain when they left the cinema that they â€˜didnâ€™t know it would be so rudeâ€™. Parents donâ€™t look at, nor care about, ratings.ï»¿"
I mean it's called the happytime murders... hopefully that will help deter them.ï»¿
Kevin Israel you would think but parents will still take their kids and then bitch about it.ï»¿
they need to slap RATED R to about half of the cover in he movies for dumb parents who dont read descriptions or know what the internet isï»¿
Martin XY it wouldnâ€™t matter a lot of them just pay no attention. Thereâ€™s this Netflix show called big mouth thatâ€™s an adult cartoon (rated TV-MA) and this mom ranted that she let her 13-year-old watch it and it was inappropriate_Ÿ˜’ï»¿
Allie Cardinal then I hope they dont blame anyone else if those kids are fucked up later onï»¿
"Martin XY oh they will. I agree that itâ€™s dumb, but itâ€™ll totally happenï»¿"
"The parent(s) should be more observant, the ratings are there for a reason lolï»¿"
We live in a world where people are eating Tide pods and falling into manholes with big caution signs in front of them because they're looking at their phones. I guarantee people will take kids to this fucking movie.ï»¿
Stanley From The Officeï»¿

Fabio Alves Show can't be that. guys not bald._Ÿ˜‰ï»¿
