I think this featured in fear thy neighbour documentary. Season 1 episode 4ï»¿
"senyum0 That's what I was thinking! You're right, it's based on that true storyï»¿"
nitagirl614 right.? When samuel l jackson put up the spot light i was like . Ahahha....ï»¿
Seem to have a problem there buddy let me see if I can solve it for you911yeah hello you seem to have a psycho racist ducking coping your department that's my neighbor and is harassing me can you ducking do something about it''ï»¿
SLJ is so believable I'm actually pissed off and annoyed at him while watching the film.ï»¿
"I'm sorry but Samuel L. Jackson is a *ucking *sshole in this movie!!!! Acting so hostile & racist towards an interracial couple, stirring up trouble, and acting all corrupt!Cool actor, did NOT like this movie!ï»¿"
Other than the ending it's a true story.ï»¿
I'm sure Mr. Jackson would take that as a compliment.ï»¿
"His role in this movie reminds me of Officer Tenpenny in GTA San Andreas, being that he generally is an asshole towards CJ and is a corrupt officer too.ï»¿"
Why are you so feeble and pathetic? Did your daddy not give you enough hugs?ï»¿
"You are very unhinged, when was the last time you walked outside?ï»¿"
"Its funny because your panicked and hysterical view of reality is very similar to many white supremacists and donaldtards. You think white people are out to get you, you think black people are betraying you, and you think   you're better than every one of them. Honestly if you take out ""africans"" and swap it with ""aryans"" you could fit right in with some klansmen. maybe you should question why your line of reasoning and logic lines up so perfectly with stupid people.ï»¿"
"BONEFACE you don't even realize how simple you are,  a scared animal lashing out on fucking YouTube videos. You don't even have a culture or history, you're just fucking black like millions of other people who don't matter. And I'm white, just like millions of other people who don't matter. Guess what buddy, human beings are all stupid chimps and we're all gonna die so you may as well stop being a giant quivering child.ï»¿"
"No you don't, you're some poor sap on the internet, no one is friends with you.  and. I. can. type. like. a retard. too. but. I. don't. because. it's. fucking. stupid. just. like. your. ignorant. self.You literally just used a racial slur against your own ethnic group, how do you get along with this ""culture"" of yours? because apparently if any one of them even associates with a white person (god forbid) they are no longer a part of your culture and you have free reign to call them whatever ignorant names you like. you are so childish; you keep making these threats like ""crakkers can die"" but are you actually going to carry them out? probably not, cause you're a spineless little spitfuck. Your culture doesn't exist because your mind doesn't exist, you're just a shell of blind, stupid hatred.ï»¿"
"I really want you to examine why your train of thought lines up so perfectly with white supremacists, you seem to have evaded that point entirely, so i'm bringing it up again. Look at any main argument of a white supremacist; its usually something to the effect of ""white people invented society and made the world a better place while black people were chimping out"" this is so disconnected from reality its hilarious. Now look at your statement ""It is a crime against humanity for Africans to marry you Neanderthal Troglodyte bastards who have caused nothing but havoc and sorrow to our race"" again, not much reality here. quite a bit of delusion. Yours, and white supremacists, main point is that there is some inherent difference between the races, something really huge and very significant that causes a divide. what's actually true is you are stupid. you aren't smart. you lack the ability to discern reality from fiction. your eyes are closed. please open them already.ï»¿"
white supremacists are the people who have done immense damage to Africans though. What even is your position? it seems like at this point you're just saying anything.ï»¿
"I love you man, every step of the way; every reply you sent to me has been exactly what I thought and hoped it to be. Somehow, you've managed to say so much and yet say absolutely nothing but blind tomfoolery. Seriously, I haven't learned anything about you or your position since we've started, you've just been repeating your initial comment with more and more words.ï»¿"
