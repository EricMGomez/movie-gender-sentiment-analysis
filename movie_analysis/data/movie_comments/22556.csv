"Came for the eddie , stayed for the dramaï»¿"

GeekGoddess me to!!!! _Ÿ˜ç_Ÿ˜çï»¿
I love this movie.ï»¿
since the runaways I'm addicted to kristen stewartÂ ï»¿
Fucking amazingï»¿
"Kristen is amazing in every film she does, she has a unique way of acting, which is why she's my favourite actor. I'm not a drama fan, AT ALL, but put her in it and I'll watch without blinking ï»¿"
I think this trailer makes the film seem really shitï»¿
"mee tooï»¿"
Just watched this for the first time. Great film.ï»¿
"i felt kinda .. sad because the part where eddie bumped his car's door into the black van he said sorry but the dude still threatened him and he said he didn't mean it im really sorry he didn't even defend himself.. if it wasn't for that old dude that saved him maybe he's face is all jacked up because of that dude that drives the black van,, and im planning on watching this since eddie is here lol I already watched hickï»¿"
Kristen was so amazing in this oneï»¿
me too :Dï»¿
"must watch drama, kristen and eddie were awesome ï»¿"
Eddie is a God.ï»¿
Nayah2134 yeeï»¿
The movie is much better than the trailer which is a good thing. I hate when trailers give too much away. This one doesn't.ï»¿
"I came for both actors, enough. ï»¿"

It's not supposed to be a southern accent. In the film it says his character's from out west. Not sure it's all that good though but at least not a southern accent lolï»¿
I seriously do not understand what this movie is about. Even after watching the trailer a dozen times. Can anybody enlighten me?ï»¿
Lol and now he's in Les Mis...ï»¿
Kristen is the only reason Im not watching this ï»¿
Came for Eddie Redmayne...and stayed for Eddieï»¿
As much as I love Eddie Redmayne is southern accent is hilariously awful! :D ï»¿
they are supposed to tell you the premise though... this trailer looks like someone edited a bunch of random clips together.ï»¿
"Eddie is the only reason im watching this. i love that guyï»¿"
this movie iss bullshitï»¿
"watch?v=lu9o733X56M&feature=relatedFULL MOVIEï»¿"
The trailer is so bad compared to the actual film!ï»¿
anyone know the beat at the end?ï»¿
Honestly.. totally confused.ï»¿
what is this movie about?ï»¿
"Go watch it! You'll be surprised it's actually pretty good. Eddie Redmayne's performance is PHENOMENAL in my opinion. It's a unique style of film that is kind of hard to get into but if you give it a chance it will surprise you(: (It might still be on Netflix instant).ï»¿"
only watching this because of Kristen Stewart :Dï»¿
"Lol me too, like every movie she stars in.ï»¿"
I didn't understand a word of this.ï»¿
"i know right ï»¿"
netflixsï»¿
"a lot of people say that kristen stewar doesnt belong to the movie on the road or any serious films because of twilight. but the truth is kristen stewart already appeared in several meaningful independent films.(the yellow handkerchief, the cake eaters, speak, into the wild, panic room, in the land of women, fierce people,)ï»¿"
same. but this movie looks like a pile of pig shit. ï»¿
PLEASE can anyone tell me what the music from 0:00 to 0:50 is??  I've been looking for a while but have found nothing!ï»¿
torrent heheï»¿
He is Matt Damons kid from the good shepard lolz ï»¿
I love this movie. So much.ï»¿
Why are the majority of people (not all of them) talking about Kirsten or vampires when Eddie Redmayne is in the videoï»¿
@DEUHDCEwh You're right. ï»¿
Kristen Stewart is AMAZING!!ï»¿
"I've developed a deep dislike for Kristen's acting, but she didn't do nearly as bad as I had expected in this movie. Other than that the other actors/actresses played their parts very convincingly and the movie was a pretty good remake of the Japanese one.ï»¿"
"Loved this movie :) I like Kristen Stewart I think she USA good actor, just not In twilight.ï»¿"
Eddie looks so young!! He's soo cute :Dï»¿
is this before or after she had a demonic vamp baby and almost died ï»¿
@issabella97 Ditto. ï»¿
Kristen is the only reason im watching thisï»¿
@MrsBrightside1001 someone has seen pillars of the earth too many times :)ï»¿
"Eddie Redmayne, you are endlessly adorable.ï»¿"
@ANTARESISHOTTOGO actually this movie is excellentï»¿
"i actually really like this film, i dont usually like these kinds of films ï»¿"
not worth seeing....ï»¿
doesnt look very good...ï»¿
Damn it. Why won't they release the film score? ï»¿
I'm seriously SICK of all the FILMSI.CO blah blah blahï»¿
I still know nothing about the movie except the fact that it has a bunch of people talking in fake southern accents.ï»¿
'The Yellow Hankercheif Full of Snot'ï»¿
she has a retarded accent hahaï»¿
What the he'll is this mo is bout ?Â¿?Â¿?Â¿ï»¿
"this movie is reallllllllllly borrrrring, it drags but it has a good story to it and very good , great acting !! ï»¿"
@pinpo87  bahahahah this not harry potter dick headï»¿
yep...another one of kristen stewart's epics ...ï»¿
@MrsBrightside1001 he is SOOOO handsomeï»¿
"ivw never hard of this movie till nowï»¿"
Very good!ï»¿
"@Kenzie509 i completely agree,most ppl tell me they think it loooks trashy but i love itï»¿"
Did anyone else feel this film could've used more character development?ï»¿
i'm confused..ï»¿
THIS MOVIE WAS AMAZING...IT MADE ME THINK ABOUT THINGS DIFFERENTLY AFTER I WATCHED ITï»¿
"the trailer was godawful.The movie was great. <3ï»¿"
"Original Japanese version is amazing. This looks like it sucks. ï»¿"
"the only reason i looked this movie up was because kristen steward is in but i'm tollay confused about most of this movie...and why name it ""the yellow handkiercheif "" the only yellow i see are some ugly flowers!!ï»¿"
"it'd be nice if there were more than 3 reviews on this that weren't spam for a torrent site.ï»¿"
so what happened to the vampire then?ï»¿
"What the eff is this about?  The trailer sucked?  Talk about little to no imagination!It's fairly simple to see what it's about, and the trailer is good insofar as it gives a hint, but does not give away, the main story.Freaking morons.  See a real film once in a while.ï»¿"
@ChadCrackerTV  THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WAS RUNNING THROUGH MY MIND!!! haha what the hell is this about?ï»¿
"@MrsBrightside1001 agreed, he is sooo fit <3 xxxï»¿"
Eddie Redmayne is the only reason I am going to watch this film ï»¿
"@uberfrozenglow seriously, i respect your opinion though i disagree :)))ï»¿"
"@leoaddict she was actually good in this one and she have something that makes people pay attention. is like william hurt, he also have that. there are actors that are great in there work but donâ€™t have that quality that makes them special. ï»¿"
@21krizchristensen i haven't seen all of them but i've seen enough. tell me one where she's agood actor and i'll watch it and review it.ï»¿
"@SaveTheZebra yes i did, i wouldn't leave a comment if i hadn't.ï»¿"
@leoaddict  I might agree with if you've already watched all of her movies.ï»¿
@leoaddict i doubt you've even seen this movie :/ï»¿
Does anyone know the second song/music in the trailer is called???ï»¿
kristen stewart doesn't suck only in twilight after all!!! she sucks in all her movies!!!! perfectly :Pï»¿
"have to admit the movie trailer was an epic fail. but the movie was incredible, so moving. ï»¿"
What is happening in this craptacular trailer? ï»¿
@Mona7447 Is it scary?? :S ï»¿
I don't really get what it's a bout but I have a feeling that it can be pretty good.ï»¿
LOOOOVE EDDIE!!!!ï»¿
"ok movie kind of slow dramatic....kristen looking great in this movie....watchable once,,,,,5/10ï»¿"
just watched it - was hoping for a twist...  well that didnt happen.. ï»¿
"Emm.. Kristen, that was weird :Oï»¿"
@carlosfile08 you sure about that? cuz that trailer seems a bit gay :Pï»¿
Just watched his film and it was brilliant. I loved it. I loved that it wasn't predictable at all... little moviss like this should deffinatly have more recognitionï»¿
"This film sucke3d ... It was like watching paint dry on a wall!!! Very ...Very boring! Characters I couldn't care about!!ï»¿"
it's crazy heart with a happy endingï»¿
"i think kristen's going to way better in this movie then in that lame saga she's been doing. she was amazingly boring in those movies and they really made me think she was a suckish actress, but tbh i think its just a suckish role, she seems good in the other movies shes in.ï»¿"
i. love. eddie redmayne. ï»¿
So sad. And Eddie Redmayne is amazing :Dï»¿
dont really like th accent kristen's doing but still cool =)ï»¿
"Does anyone else think that Evan guy looks like a girl?? And is anyone else extremely attracted to that??i think im alone hereï»¿"
"OMFG. THIS IS AMAZING, years ago  they made this movie in turkey!! i watched it last week and i cried my eyeballs out, can you believe they made one of my favourite movies in english with my favourite actress!!ï»¿"
"I just watched this and its one of the best movies ever made. Its so heartfelt and inspiring, your stupid not to watch this movie.ï»¿"
ill try to putt the movie on my chanel this week hoping it wont be deleted :)ï»¿
i watched this today! it was ok:P it was really weird though.ï»¿
"@pup101 i looked up what a handkerchief is yet, and this is because i told you that in german it is translated as a sail, and in this translation it seems to make senseï»¿"
"@pup101 well, in german it is translated to be a sail, so i guessed it would be this one he's holding thereï»¿"
I've Lived In Louisiana My Entire Life..I Was Born && Raised In Louisiana..&& I Dont Think I Have An Accent..But Whenever I Go 2 Texas Or Northern Arkansas People Tell Me I Have An Accent..But Im 4rm North Louisiana..The Southerners Talk Way Differentï»¿
@pup101 at 1:05 he's holding itï»¿
I still don't understand what the movie is about :\ï»¿
"Does anyone know if this is actually a good film, or is it as confusing as the trailer? ï»¿"
"i really don't understand this trailer, but alot of people say this is a really good movie. so i'm gonna look it 0=3ï»¿"
@likeastarbaby: The film seems like a bit of a poem.ï»¿
@ThaMunchkin007 and then you'll stalk her to her house where you'll cut her throat in her sleep and rape her corpse right. lolï»¿
@ThaMunchkin007 Then definitely watch Adventureland and In the Land of Women. Their great Kristen Stewart movies and watch The Runaways when it come out. ï»¿
"What's confusing? It's about two stories that collide, and the search for meaning. ï»¿"
"This trailer is a win. It has no meaning at all. No way to mock it. I'm so confused right now, I don't know what else to write. Haha. Film-trailer-fail-but-kinda-win. Lol.ï»¿"
This is exactly  remake of  the Japanese classic movie performed by Ken Takakura.  ï»¿
i'm just gonna take a guess that the yellow handkerchief is the thing he uses to cover his head in the rain... idk i'm just taking a guessï»¿
"Youji Yamada directed this story in 1977.youtube.com/watch?v=bbMSoXKXWr8same story.  It was good movie and happy ending.ï»¿"
"@Juliettedeuz I still didn't find it on that site.:(ï»¿"
It's weird not seing her as Bella swanï»¿
Shouldn't trailers make you want to see a movie? The only way anyone will see it is because Kristen is in itï»¿
looks good XDï»¿
i didn't see any handkerchief... i saw a yellow rain pancho.ï»¿
what is this movie even about? im so confused!!!ï»¿
wtf is this????ï»¿
it seems really cuteï»¿
this looks boring... srry Kstew ily but geezxï»¿
The reason this trailer doesn't make sense is because it's not the actual trailer. It's fan made. Notice how it didn't have a rating or who directed it and who produced it.ï»¿
they all have southern accents! it's so weird thinking tht kristen stewart has one in this movieï»¿
movie sucksï»¿
"this is the stupidest most funny movie hahahhahaa  Made for teens age 14 and older XD  LinkFlix . com :)ï»¿"
what the hell is this movie about?ï»¿
"end song anyone, anyone.........feel its just a real random bit but maybe someone knows it, avisame caposï»¿"
i dont even know what the fuck this is?ï»¿
"anyone know the last song...........i think it looks good though, heartfeltï»¿"
"after watching this trailer i have NO idea what this film is about, LOL. rather than making me interested in the movie it just makes it seem more boring :|ï»¿"
"I think it's about the two kids helping that guy find himself again, or realizing what's important to him in his life. I think it's harsh to say that this movie looks weird, though.ï»¿"
...huh?ï»¿
i didnt get it =/ï»¿
wait...what?ï»¿
i have no idea from watching this what it;s even about.ï»¿
"@dlp1994 yeah omg i love tht movieï»¿"
this looks like it will make no sense...ï»¿
what is it about?ï»¿
its dumb and weird and the trailer is just random clips of the movie squashed together.ï»¿
whats the song?ï»¿
looks like something that i'll like. great actors. hoping it's a good story too.ï»¿
Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!ï»¿
@dashana0880  The Runawaysï»¿
this is a terrible trailer. it doesnt make me want to see the movie. its just a whole bunch of clips chucked together. the other trailer is much better.ï»¿
@dashana0880 The Runawaysï»¿
where can i watch this movie please???ï»¿
"im not trying to spoil the movie or anything, but the funniest line was when the guy says to kristen, ""im obsessing about you becuase you'e so beatiful and it makes me horny!"" i was cracking up... and their in a motel bed when that happens so she kisses him and then he trys to rape her! go see it!ï»¿"
"@dashana0880 its called ""the runaways"", and it comes out in theaters tomorrow.ï»¿"

Kristen Stewart acting like Kristen Stewart except with an accent.ï»¿
if you didnt see the handkerchief you are a sex addict!ï»¿
you can only understand why its called that if you watch the movie... it has a very emotional ending - it made me cryï»¿
can you see it on the web? :)ï»¿
it looks crap! whys it called the yellow handkerchief???ï»¿
this movie was AMAZING! you should go see it. its a lot better than the trailer makes it seem...ï»¿

i love kristen!! she's so talented!ï»¿
she luks gorgeous (kristen) :)ï»¿
i agreee Ntwilightfan17ï»¿
"wow, the first movie trailer that did not bore me half to death: no unnecessary sweetness, ""cool"" characters and that whole hollywood superficiality. looks like somethin thats been quite rare around the states lately: indie.ï»¿"
"that was a really bad trailer. I haven't seen the movie but they could have made this look better. the acting was so slow and monotone (classic Kristen) and horrific accents. wow.ï»¿"
this luks lik pure and utter muck!ï»¿
"@spraif uhhh, trust me,'twilight is a good movie, her role suits the movie, but every other movie, like this one, the cake eaters, speak, she just ruins it by making it slow with her slow movements and late replys...ï»¿"
"@anzzbanannz lol watch Into the Wild, I havet watched twilight and i can tel you she is a great actress if twilight is some cheesy high budget movie that doesnt mean the actors in it sucks...ï»¿"
"WTF, Kristen Stewart has no talent AT ALL, the only reason why she is famous is because of the twilight saga, orelse she would have been another Mrs no one!ï»¿"
this trailer tells me nothin...the only thing it tells me is that they have a country accent.ï»¿
It's a remake. Im sorry it wasn't spelled out for you with dancing puppets!ï»¿
"HAHA, i can't get past thefact that she has an accent.but i do kinda wanna watch this.ï»¿"

My thoughts exactly.   I couldn't even begin to tell you what it might be about.   It is either an awful trailer or a plotless movie.... or both.ï»¿
what the hell is this effin movie about! i feel like they just put kirsten steward in it and didn't care to make the trailer cool asuming just cuz shes in it we will wath!!! Fail!!!ï»¿
huh kirsten looks pretty but the movie looks broing and not really entertainingï»¿
omg i hate when people talk shit bout kristen. if she wasnt a good actor she wouldnt have been on twilightï»¿
"@Rubzy4lyf it's already been released, i saw it in 2008 at a film festival.it's because now kristen stewart is famous they can release it on a bigger scale with a wider release. (and make more money.)i <3 eddie redmayne.ï»¿"
"ok yeah roberts movie looks waaayyy better. in fact, i kno its gonna be better.this is just bout two kids taking a road trip with a criminal.maybe its cause i kno wht happens but roberts movie is alot better.and kristen can't act. she really is the same in movies even though all her characters are different, and slapping on a southern accent did not change it.its actually a pretty bad 1.ï»¿"
what a boring trailer... bunch of dramatic clips that tells me nothing about the movie....ï»¿
i dont get what its about..ï»¿
"This trailer isn't as good as the new one that just came out!  I have been waiting for this movie to see the light of day for what seems like FOREVER!  Can't believe we finally have a date, so excited!ï»¿"
that was a HORRIBLE trailer. seriously. and the plot doesn't interest me at all o.Oï»¿
"it's entitled the yellow handkerchief coz it's based on a story about a father who was in jail for a very long tym and was still accepted by his family by putting a yellow handkerchief in a tree showing that the family still loves the guy. The director kinda like based the movie by this inspiring story. Got it now?..hope so^^,ï»¿"
"Eww, why is it yellow?ï»¿"
"these are awful southern accents, but it could still be good. we'll see.ï»¿"
"where i can watch this movieÂ¨?onlineï»¿"
"is this movie related to the song by tony christie, tie a yellow ribbon? its kinda like the song.. man goes to prison asks his family if they still want him.. if they do tie a yellow ribbon on the old oak treeï»¿"
What is this movie about? The only thing i can tell from this movie is some guy gets arrested and Kristen Stewart is in it...ï»¿
"there was a yellow scarf hanging over the lampshade near the end when the woman was lying in bed 1:48 , but that's as close to a handkerchief as I could see:)ï»¿"
