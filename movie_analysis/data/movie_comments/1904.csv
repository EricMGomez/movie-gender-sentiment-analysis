Is there any reason why they don't speak Japanese? (sorry I havent watched the movie)ï»¿
"If you looking for awesome history movie I recommend you "" The Treacherous "" it is a korean movieï»¿"
I've just finished reading the book. I cried when  Chairman reveal that he was the who send the Geisha to train sayuri .ï»¿
Lmaoooo the MadTv version is just as goodï»¿
They did her character age progression SO well.ï»¿
I read the novel for my own pleasure while I was in middle school and was swept away by it! The film minus a few deviations was very true to the story and the trials Sayuri endured in pursuit of happiness. The cast was outstanding and the production left me moved beyond words. Certainly a story anyone can internalize with.ï»¿
this whole movie is a nut bust for me..love asian womenï»¿
"I hate the author of the book, Arthur Golden, for how he portrayed geishas and what he did to Iwasaki Mineko. And this movie didn't exactly help either. First, she had to live through the book and then this move. This is NOT the real life or real story of the geisha! Before watching this movie or reading the book, read Iwasaki Mineko book, its called 'Geisha, a Life' in the U.S. and 'Geisha of Gion in the U.K.'ï»¿"
Still a great movie ï¿_ï»¿
"Although these Chinese actresses tried very hard to pretend to be a Japanese, their Chinese characteristics are too obvious. It is okay for westerners but for a Chinese/Japanese audience, it is awkward.ï»¿"
Alguien tiene el link?ï»¿
It's the female version of karate kidï»¿
A movie Scarlett Johansson couldn't put her hands on.ï»¿
Was that coach of the geisha also the villain in Crazy Rich Asians?ï»¿
This was taught to us in schoolï»¿
I wish they would have chosen a Japanese actress..Amazing g movie over all thoï»¿
Dyed Bliss same hereï»¿
*Thoughï»¿
I like this movie. âù_âù_âù_âù_ï»¿
"I don't get why it's such a problem when a non Japanese plays a Japanese character.  I mean,  so what? There are many non American actors playing American characters,  and no one says anything.ï»¿"
"america dont have a culture while japan does and they're using their culture but not their actorsand lets not forget that the west and especially americans and hollywood think all asians are alikeï»¿"
Umm...Am I the only one who is bothered by the fact that none of the actresses are Japanese? Is it really so hard to find Japanese talent?ï»¿
"No, they just refused to act in this movie because it is a bit insulting on the true art of being an actual geisha.  Hollywood did get a few things right, but the prostitution and the dancing was a pretty bad move on their behalf, it was just.. not accurate.ï»¿"
A chinese and malaysian playing japanese characters.ï»¿
That is a very good movieï»¿
2018?ï»¿
Gw suka film ini banyak banget adegan ngewe nyaï»¿

Dem eyes tho like if u agreeï»¿
"*damn , (?) , *Youï»¿"
How do I do the fan trick.ï»¿
"After watching this movie, i practised a little about having fan tricks.. _Ÿ˜‚ Flipping it in the air and landing on your hand like it was a rewind.. _Ÿ__ Also tried using umbrellas.. Funny..ï»¿"
But she wasnâ€™t Japanese....ï»¿
âù_âù_âù_âù_âù_ï»¿
this trailer is a bit too spoilerishï»¿
Truly outstanding movie!!!!!ï»¿
Niceï»¿
WHICH ONE IS NOBU?ï»¿
The book describe Mameha as a very beautiful person but looks kinda dull. ARE YOU SERIOUS LOOK AT MAMEHA HERE SHE LOOKS SO PRETTY THAT I CAN'T EVEN HANDLE HER SMILE. okay Hatsumoto is very hot indeedï»¿
I saw this in the movie theater when I was 8 years old with my grandparents. I had to leave the theater because one of the scenes showed little Chiyo getting beaten. This is one of my favorite movies as I gotten older _Ÿ™‚ï»¿
Those eyes... âù_ï»¿
"this trailer is awesome, and the movie was great as well. I haven't read the novel though. :)ï»¿"
Come on! Stopping a man with a single look is impossible!!ï»¿
"Seen the movie from beginning, but not till the end , but i still loved it, including the man she was in love with i too was in love, i'm so jeaulous of her right nowï»¿"
Hold on that's Mr Saito from inception...wowï»¿
Where can I get the movie I read the book twice I had to laminate each page and the book has more than 1000 pages _Ÿ˜… and this was like years ago but I can remember some iconic scenes ok I'm prolly sounding like a freak please gimme the linkï»¿
The book is brilliantï»¿
"I am currently reading the book and remembered it had a movie, so I search for the trailer. I'm too surprised (and disappointed) it wasn't in Japanese. I was thinking they'll cast Japanese actors & actresses and have everything in english sub. but yeah right, even in anime, american's dont do subs.ï»¿"
November Lee at least they casted asians have you see ghost in the shell or other white washed moviesï»¿
"Whoa, they're not whiteï»¿"
I want to be Asian with blue eyesï»¿
Shame that they speak in English...ï»¿
Back when trailers didnâ€™t show the entire film :)ï»¿
I remember watching this when I was little. It feels so nostalgic!ï»¿
me too!!ï»¿
Ø_Ø±Ø¨Ù_ Ø·Ù‚ Ù„Ø§Ù_Ùƒ _Ÿ˜‚âù_ï»¿
Book is the bestï»¿
"This is one of those cases where the film was actually far, far better than the book. The book was written by a man from a largely masculine perspective- the film is the opposite. There are some inaccuracies, but the spirit of the story is kept to more faithfully by the film. And the film makes it clear that it was INSPIRED BY, not TELLING UNADULTERATED, the true story of a woman. This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, and it inspired me to learn more about the floating world. Bravo!ï»¿"

"This didn't get all the recognition it should have! It should have cleaned up in awards.. nut nope.. One of my all time favorites, I never get tired of watching it...ï»¿"
They don't make movies like that anymore...ï»¿
Great movieï»¿
"Omg I didnâ€™t know this was a movieI loved the bookï»¿"

Real question I want to know is why she has blue eyes _Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
"Perry potato read the book.. she has a lot of water in her, thatâ€™s important to the story. And actually in the book they explain she has grey eyes, not blue eyesï»¿"

Ahhh I knew she looked familiar she was in the Rush Hour 2 movie lolï»¿
SUBAN LA PELICULA COMPLETAï»¿
"I just bought the book I'm so exited I already watched the movie 8 years ago I don't remember the details and reading the book gonna make my imagination work I love itï»¿"
"I was disappointed very much.I can't understand why American filmmaker deceive about Japanese Geisha and culture and tradition. In this film,actresses of Geisha are Chinese actress. All of  hairstyles makeup, how to wear kimono, name, behavior  how to dance  ,are different from japanese geisha.ã€€Those are fake.  Geisha is not prostitutes.  If people believe that this is real ,I'm very sad.  This movie is totally fantasy. It is much better watching  BBC documentary geisha and maiko, than this movie.ã€€This is awfulã€€and let people misunderstand . I am disgusting that Hollywood filmmakers are create such movies like this and Last samurai.ï»¿"
Yes really sad :( I have high respect for geisha.ï»¿
Good ass boookkï»¿
Why is there a Last Samurai OST in it? :Pï»¿
"I loved the book, and I wanna see the movieï»¿"
Why is there the music from Last Samurai?ï»¿
One of my favorite movies !ï»¿
The author stole the story ilegally and messed with it. Also this woman does not look japanese at all. I wonder why.ï»¿
she isn't Japanese. no Japanese actresses were willing to play the roleï»¿
"Japanese actresses refused to play role in this movie, so they ended up hiring foreigners instead. And that because there's a misconception in that book that arthur wrote. Japanese girls are not forced to be geisha, they have to do it on their own will. Geisha dont sell their body nor getting invovled in adult entertainment. They sell their skills. This movie and book is complety trash, many japenese got offended with it. And it just put Geisha into bad reputation and please dont believe in americans documentary completely false factsï»¿"

"I am not into reading books but God damn, After having read the Book - ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", My whole perception of life changed !Movie is simply trash !ï»¿"
MelodicNostalgic read the book Geisha A life by Mineko Iwasaki. It is the correct depiction of a geisha. The author of the Memoirs of geisha basically took her life story and twisted it to show them like prostitutesï»¿

"Better if they had Japanese actresses. They act differently, they speak differently, they act differently. Also, geisha are/were not prostitutes. They've been mistaken for oiran. The Japanese are really weirded out by this film.ï»¿"
TOTAL TRAVESTYï»¿
The book is even better!!ï»¿
"Safaa Asloune so true,you cannot love the movie after reading the bookï»¿"
"This movie is about a geisha, but somehow I am seeing an Oiran's shoes.This happens, when Hollywood gets involved: False interpretation of culture.ï»¿"
"Nyan Tsuki Clothes, makeup, hair...  all wrong in this movie...ï»¿"
"The book is all wrong too And I am not just talking about the shoes etc Both movie and the book are relying on false epicness. They are a picture book... very nice to look at, most of the aesthetics were beautiful, the author is descriptive enough, but that's it. They are pretty and that is it. The realness of life is taken away. The stakes are taken away. And instead of a life of a geisha we get a love story that has exactly 3 pages of development. (Also both book and the show start of giving me hope yet end up severely anticlimatic)ï»¿"
"i think the book was written from an outsider's point of view, so it wasn't accurate at all with the woman's life (i heard the book was written by some caucasian dude)ï»¿"
Book was written by a westerner and basically ruined the actual geishas lifeï»¿
"The part where you saw the oiran's shoes was when she was performing the snow dance. The snow dance is a very popular kabuki dance about a prostitute. So Sayuri kinda had to look the part, I guess. What really irks me is that women weren't allowed to perform in kabuki shows, so why the directors added that in is beyond me.ï»¿"
Nyan Tsuki I agree.ï»¿
"A best selling book tho:Played by some chinese celebsHans Zimmer's ""The Last Samurai"" OSTï»¿"
That last samurai soundtrack though :)ï»¿
I just cannot get over her accent when speaking English... it's clearly a Chinese-English accent... ugh... Stupid ass Hollyfuckinwoodï»¿
this is art. not dumb  hollywood filmsï»¿
_¥_£_’_¬_¡_ê_“_§ Ó¨_“Ó¨_“_”Ó¨_› I think it is a Hollywood Film tho :/ï»¿
I'm watching this right now!ï»¿
"Her name is Zhang Ziyi, not Ziyi Zhang... Chinese have their surnames before their birth nameï»¿"
I still get goosebumps every time I watch this. Both book and movie-adaptation are masterpieces.ï»¿
"A good -- not great -- movie.Â  Watchable and entertaining throughout, though.Â  There are some undeniably stunningÂ scenes in it, and the acting by the cast isÂ fine across the board.Â  It impressively won a few Oscars, but nothing in the major categories.ï»¿"
"- i want a life that is mine.The best sentence in the entire film!ï»¿"
"Even though it's suppose to be Japanese, the actors where chinese?But that girl child though...so beautifulï»¿"
Japanese actors weren't interestedï»¿
"In whole of Japan they couldn't find 5 girls to play the 4 geshas, mother and auntie, and all the extras boicotted the film as well?ï»¿"
@Stefan Makara Name me some japanese actress who were big in the hollywood in the early 2000s.ï»¿
@poortaiwanese how are they supposed to get big when Holliwood doesn't care to hire them?ï»¿
@Stefan Makara Japanese actress are not known for good acting skills.ï»¿
"This movie is a pure piece of art, and the book is just as enchanting.ï»¿"
where can I watch this pleaseï»¿
"HEAR ME OUT :D :D I've been studying Geisha & Maiko for 2 and a half years now!! I think people are getting confused between 'Geisha' and 'Oiran'... I will define the two words!:DGeisha definition: Geisha are women trained in traditional arts like dancing, music (shamisen, taito drum, singing, flute, etc), and tea ceremony! They preform at kabuki (traditional Japanese theatres, where people dance and put on plays), local festivals, and private parties (which are expensive). At the private parties geisha entertain their guests by dancing, singing, serving sake, and playing games (like Rock Paper Scissors, and Konpira Funefune)-- There is not prostitution at the private parties, in fact a lot of a lot of guests at the parties are female, and there are kids at the parties too! It's a great thing to do with you family! :D Oiran definition: Oiran and TayÅ« were high ranking prostitutes, and are disappeared after the anti-prostitution laws in 1958. They looked VERY similar to geisha, and were trained in traditional as well.BOTTOM LINE. Geisha WERE NOT allowed to get together with they're clients. It wasn't, and still isn't, part of a geisha's job to be a prostitute. Geisha weren't/aren't prostitutes. Oiran were prostitutes. I think all the confusion came about when the first Americans went over to Japan during WW2. Because there were these oiran and bathhouse geisha (bathhouse geisha were girls that worked at 'onsen' hot springs, they were prostitutes. They weren't real geisha.), that called themselves 'Geee-sha girls', and they were prostitutes. The Americans thought that the 'Geee-sha girls' were real geisha, so from that day on Westerners though real Geisha were Oiran prostitutes...I think this movie is very stupid, and really a let down (because I was excited when I heard about it), because it's so far from the truth. And not just the movie, the book as well... Why didn't the author, Arthur Golden, just make the book about Oiran?? IF YOU WANT TO READ A BOOK ABOUT A REAL GEISHA, I KNOW ONE!! There's a book written by a REAL retired geisha!! The famous geisha Golden interviewed for research!!The book is called,Geisha: A Life By Mineko IwasakiAlso, Maiko/Geisha DID NOT sell their virginity to the highest bidder!!!! Oiran DID though.Also, the dancing in the movie sucks XD But the costumes are good :))ï»¿"
Anyone who has done any amount of research into this book/movie know it was fiction. Hopefully they get the difference.ï»¿
"There is a book that was written by a former geisha as well, it's called ""autobiography of a geisha"", it talks about her real life and somehow prostitution. And Golden did not only interviewed the author of ""Geisha: A Life"". I mean, he might've interviewed a lot of former geisha, who before had maybe the mizuage ritual, before it was declared illegalï»¿"
"Sara G. That second part helps so much. I was wondering why foreigners thought that Geisha were prostitutes and just figured it was because of the fancy concubines. There is still prostitution though, it is a certain part of the clans. Oiran were the prostitutes put in the wooden cages, yeah?ï»¿"
Thank u!ï»¿
Thank you for enlightening us !ï»¿
thanks for the description.ï»¿
Mineko never wanted to write her story down. She was forced because of this asshole Golden who stole her life story (and messed it up).ï»¿
Sara G. Yeah i was thinking that too... They didnt need to sell their virginity to theyr danna though...ï»¿
This is a book about a REAL geisha. This is HER story before she died. Everything is real besides a fee name change due to social statusï»¿
Thanks! That was interesting _Ÿ™‚ï»¿
This is the story of a real geisha I this is a true storyï»¿
"I'm really just asking out of my curiosity, is  this also applies on the world war era?ï»¿"
THANK YOUUUUï»¿
viewed this trailer after watching a geisha girl's documentary and found this movie far more different. thank you for your explanationï»¿
"I remember seeing the ""A true geisha can stop a man in his tracks with a single look."" Scene on tv  when I was little, and always wanted to see the full movie but all I knew about it was that one scene where she exchanges glances with the boy on the bike, years later I finally found this movie! Man that one scene left such an impact.ï»¿"
LVA M Congratulations!ï»¿
LVA M read the book. The scene is different..ï»¿
"the book is an absolute masterpiece of literature, probably the best book I have ever readï»¿"
"The scene where the boy crashes were mere conversation of Mameha and Chiyo later on changed Sayuri after being Mameha's younger sister. I hate the trailer, they changed it to protege. Hahaï»¿"
LAVA M lol ikr! I also just saw this on tv when I was like 6 or 7 and I only found it after 8 years!!!ï»¿
bruh same my father was watching it back then when i was like 7 and that scene is all i remember now im 18 and ive finally found itï»¿
One of the best books I've readï»¿
How much that you bought??ï»¿
Nurhikmah Bahru I bought it for 10$ï»¿
The chairman has the friendliest expressionsï»¿
Chinese actresses make very unconvincing Japanese women. All the subtle demeanors and body language are gone. Very bad imitation. Use a real Japanese to play a Japanese next time please!ï»¿
The Japanese were not willing to play the role.ï»¿
"funny, which Japanese actress can you count on that are more famous than Zhang Ziyi, Gong Li?ï»¿"
i dont really care cause they were great in the movieï»¿
I saw this movie years ago when I was a child and was always under the impression that geisha's were from chinese culture XD until now.ï»¿
"@Melissa H Geishas actually did originate in China, so you are not wrong.ï»¿"
poortaiwanese wtf noï»¿
poortaiwanese the courtesans thing in asia started in japan w the oirans during edo periodï»¿
poortaiwanese ppl from all asia went to japan  just to visit yoshiwaraï»¿
@gab LoL the culture existed in Tang and Song dynasty from 660AD till 1279 AD. Get gud in asian history weeabooï»¿
@gab 'the courtesans thing in asia started in japan w the oirans during edo period'        Why the fk are you talking about oirans? They are prostitutes.ï»¿
"poortaiwanese courtesans thing  IN ASIA started in china, ( COURTESANS ARE ORIGINALLY FROM EUROPE) BUT U CANT SAY GEISHAS WERE ORIGINALLY FROM CHINA, like they have very different traditions and customs, and geishas, like the origins of the geisha cultura originated while oirans where the most known courtesans, but they existed back then.ï»¿"
"@gab 90% of the stuff in japan originated in China, just because it doesn't exist anymore in modern China doesn't mean its not true.  The name æ—¥æœ¬ ,land of the rising sun (Japan) even came from China. Its just foolish to disconnect japanese culture and Ancient China.ï»¿"
Love how around 1:50 the trailer uses part of the score from The Last Samurai.ï»¿
Correct me if I'm wrong: So Geisha are basically virgin masterers of all arts who hang out with men but don't have any sex.ï»¿
"Meyra Supposedly don't have any sex...ï»¿"
That's what I was thinkingï»¿
"It wasnt their role, or their purpose, to perform sexual duties. just entertainment. however, there are many pieces of evidence to suggest that some geisha were used for sex. Japan has never shied away from sex like we do in the West, but sex workers are not held to the same standard as Geisha are in Japanï»¿"
"Meyra A geisha is ""a work of art on the move"": she sells her company, whose quality is peculiar, as she is refined, cultivated, fascinating. However, the company of a geisha was also sought for the simple, and if we want to define it as such, ""erotic"" pleasure to spend time with a charming woman. It could actually happen that the geisha had sexual intercourse with some clients, but above all with her ""Danna"", a man who maintained her high standard of living and often benefited from her company, even sexually. For a Western it is very difficult to understand the erotic imagination of a Japanese, especially in the 1900s, and the fact that the geisha also sold their body but did not MAINLY it.ï»¿"
"Meyra They were just performers, yes. I think that what people get confused about is how the concubines and geisha both dressed very beautifully. From what I know though, sex slaves were put in giant wood cages to be chosen by men (they were to flaunt themselves to bring in money for family). Geisha were not to be touched, but that doesn't mean that it didn't happen. Geisha basically give their life to the performance house (I don't know what it is called, so I just call it this. There are houses they live in in groups and get taught. They have to discard everything, including their phone if it is present day. I don't fully remember everything, but there are documentaries you can find on Youtube if you are interested). The way the obi is tied signifies that they are not to be touched.ï»¿"
"Geisha are female entertainers,but oiran and yuujo were prostitutes. Since they all worn elaborate outfits and make-up, people assumed that geisha are also prostitutes. Hope that helps :)ï»¿"
Meyra no they do have sex with some of themï»¿
"Purely, they're entertainer, art for art. There's another type/name for those who sex instead, i'm not sure what's the name but definitely not geishaï»¿"
myriam gatti Wow! What an explanation!ï»¿
"Kenadi Marshall Okiya. They call their house Okiya where the Geisha live with their ""mother""ï»¿"
I think she does that thing with the man she loves...not as a geisha  but as a loverï»¿
"Don't I wish that I could bring myself to watch this movie, but nope, not after having read the book two years after it came out and absolutely loving it... These actors do nothing to make the characters come to life, they look completely wrong ( too bony to ever be believable as traditional geishas, for one thing ) and most of them are TOO OLD ( Ken Watanabe, I'm looking at you. ) Maybe one day somebody will actually turn the book into a high-quality miniseries ( on Netflix, maybe?) and we can have genuine Japanese actors and a bit more thought and effort put into the actual script. I live in hope...ï»¿"
"Fritha71 the book actually does not really follow or depict authentic Geisha life, better yet watch a documentary if you want to learn. Even the Geisha interviewed received backlash for giving out details about the topic.ï»¿"
"That's True, now that person  wrote a book herself, she's Mineko Iwasaki, and the book is ""Geisha of Gion"" (UK) and ""Geisha: A life"" (USA). I loved that book. I suggest to read it !! She was the one that sued Arthur Golden, because some parts of the book depict from her life, and because it breached the contract of confidentiality!! Because it is the geisha tradition of secrecy to the outside world. And many think Geisha are prostitutes, but they're not, what they do is ART !!! And Entertain their customers !! Please read it, it's a beautiful book, it opens your eyes and explains the truth !!!Sorry the long comment !!ï»¿"
The book is a MASTERPIECE. So I personally don't think that anyone should even try to make an adaption of it. They'll simply ruin it :)ï»¿
I wonder if her eyes are  blue  in fact or  just contact lenses/ some special effects?ï»¿
lensesï»¿
"rimasu You can't be serious. Naturally blue eyes don't look ANYTHING like thatï»¿"
"éœ§è£¡æ_¢è_±æ°´ä¸_æœ›æœˆ I dunnoh, I know mixed race people whose eyes may look unnatural on them...ï»¿"
I watched this show about a Korean girl who was born with blue eyes. Her eyes looked similar to this girls.ï»¿
The main actress is Chinese. The same girl that acted in Crouching tiger hidden dragon and Rush Hour 2. Her eyes  are definitely naturally brown. Those have to be lenses she was using.ï»¿
"In the book she has shiny gray eyes like a mirror, not blue ones.I wish they couldve gotten gray lenses for the actress, I bet they wouldve looked better and less cartoonish than the blue ones.ï»¿"
this is one of the movies i can watch a lot and still never be boredï»¿
Though I really wish they had used a Japanese actressï»¿
M Dixon I've read some articles saying Japanese actresses were not very interested in the role. Perhaps that's why they casted a Chinese actress instead. ï»¿
"Iaong Lee The reason Japanese actors didn't want to take the role, was because the book was written by a Caucasian writer (whole only shadowed a single Japanese Geisha, he basically culturally ripped off her story/butchered it after she died). Thus, the book is HUGELY inaccurate to her life. Many Japanese found it offensive, so only non-Japanese actresses were willing to play the role.ï»¿"
M Dixon in Japan geishas are seen as shameful (from what I've heard) nowadays so Japanese women did not auditionï»¿
unit104099032 now that's sadï»¿
M Dixon baby stepsï»¿
Dangerously Pink that's not trueï»¿
"Well citizens of Japan weren't too happy with the book, neither the film. Also for a film like this you need a somewhat familiar actress, and Ziyi Zhang does have a face and acting capability that is hard to forget!ï»¿"
me too but that's hard to do when not a ton of japanese people were interestedï»¿
"There's plenty of Japanese actors in the movie. Mother, young Sayuri, the chairman, pumpkin and several more, they are all from Japan.ï»¿"
"Same, but when Japanese complained of their not being any big Japanese actresses playing characters such as Mameha and Sayuri, the directors replied that hardly any Japanese actresses auditioned so they chose Michelle Yeoh, Gong Li, and Zhang Ziyi. It would have been nice for more accuracy in ethnicity, but the movie was still good.ï»¿"
"Dangerously Pink Gosh....  Geisha is not seen as shameful in Japan, it's the ignorent foreigners that think geisha is prostitute ! Their belt is tied strictly on their back, and this indicates that they are not to be touched. ãÅªã‚“ãÅ§æ—¥æœ¬äººå¥_å„ªãÅŒãÅ“ãÅ®æ˜ ç”»ãÅ«å‡ºæ_”ãÅ—ãÅŸãÅèãÅªãÅ‹ãÅ£ãÅŸãÅ‹ãÅŒã‚èãÅ‹ãÅ£ãÅŸæ°—ãÅŒãÅ—ãÅ_ãÅ™â€_ï»¿"

"To unit104099032:This is not true. The writer was writing the book from the geisha's words, which means exactly what she was telling him. She was telling her true life story. She agreed to tell her story on condition that he would publish the book only after her death and all others' that she mentioned  in the book; some people's names she changed (b/c they had very high positions), but other peoples' names she didn't change. The book is AMAZING!!! (Regarding some Japanese people that you're mentioning here, if it's true that some are saying that is inaccurate story, well, people always react negatively when they hear the truth about themselves. Nobody likes to hear unpleasant truth...)ï»¿"
"Yes, Aidana, the movie is different from the book (I didn't watch it yet :), but even from all several scenes that I watched in youtube I saw contradictions with the book. I was replying to the comment of ""unit104099032"". I'm not sure why my comment is shown here instead of under ""unit104099032"".ï»¿"
"Aidana, please don't get upset. When I said that people usually react negatively on truth! I meant about any people, not only Japanese people of course. I was replying to ""unit104099032""'s comment where he/she was attacking the writer by saying that ""..the book is hugely inaccurate.. and many Japanese people found it offensive"". I am personally always trying to respect any culture. I found the geisha's story fascinated, and I'm truly thankful to her that she agreed to tell her story to the world, and I applaud to the writer, who encouraged her to do so! Unfortunately, in most cases movies completely change the story of the book (not only for that book and movie, but in general). And it's very unfortunate that majority of people prefer to watch movies instead of reading good and informative books.So, are you saying that geishas still exist in Japan??!! Wow! I heard that they don't...ï»¿"
she doent even look japanese.ï»¿
"dancerloverish they're still exist, but not many of them are remains in japanï»¿"
dancerloverish what is the book called?ï»¿
"Mya Norman Memoirs of a Geisha, same as the titleï»¿"
M Dixon same sentimentsï»¿
I have been so sllllooooooowwww because I've just finished the book two days ago and been wondering if my memory was right and if there could really be a movie. I have been thinking of a lot of japanese actresses who could play the role and I'm quite surprised to find out it's no japaneseï»¿
I have no issues with Zhang ZiYi being Sayuri because we all know her. She's one of China's best actresses and pretty at that but this this could have been better if it were portrayed by a Japanese actress. Much more convincing. Glad they used a Japanese actress as the young Chiyo though.ï»¿
Dangerously Pink but shameful roles are the most intriguing. Interesting. It will be utterly beautiful. I guess the casting crew didn't search enough actresses and just simply settled with who they haveï»¿
Charlie yet the main actresses are not Japanese. I wonder whyï»¿
not a but 3 chinese actresses...ï»¿
"Even though I am a Chinese, I'd still prefer that they'd cast a Japanese in this movie cause it is their culture and history after all.ï»¿"
though she's still prettyï»¿
They still know Chinese martial art. Act in Japanese culture.ï»¿
"It's an English speaking, American written film, it's basically an American imagination of Japan, the ethnicity accuracy doesn't matter at all since there's barely anything accurate about it.ï»¿"
at least it wasn't Scarlett Johanssonï»¿
"'Though I really wish they had used a Japanese actress'     There weren't any famous japanese female actress in the early 2000s.Zhang ZiYi was already famous in the hollywood for Couching tiger and Hidden dragon, rush hours etc.ï»¿"
@Keili Chen Tsai Chin is also in the movie.ï»¿
This movie is breathtaking â™¡ï»¿
one of the best movies I've watched 10/10ï»¿
"I just realized that towards the end of the trailer, the music from The Last Samurai was being used to add to the ""epicness"" of the trailer. And I'm like that's ironic that that music is being used considering that Ken Watanabe was in The Last Samurai and also playing the Chairman in this film. Just thought it was interesting.ï»¿"
One of my favorite moviesï»¿
Love this movieï»¿
this movie is amazingï»¿
"free bird, This is my childhood movie.ï»¿"
The book is even better.ï»¿
Must take place during WWII.ï»¿
Nick Hasey correctï»¿
Thanks! I heard Steven Spielberg was the executive producer in this one.ï»¿
"Nick Hasey post WWII actually, late 50s - early 60s I believe.ï»¿"
"Tuton25 it takes place before, during and after WWII. After all, the film encompasses several decades of her lifeï»¿"
I would've fallen off my bike too. Those eyes are enchanting.ï»¿
Yeah but not realï»¿
Her eyes are beautiful but its only contact lensesï»¿
Reggie Regina lolï»¿
"Yes, but there indeed are East asians with monolids but also coloured/light colored eyes, somtimes even blue naturally. Very beautiful ! :)ï»¿"
This was actually a true story and she did have eyes like thatï»¿
"No, the way that she stares. It makes you feel like she likes you but she's shy about itï»¿"
"TheRed Rose It's heavily based on the testimony of Mineko Iwasaki, but the film is quite innacurate and not entirely a true story. Check out Geisha of Gion for a more accurate depiction of life as a Geisha.ï»¿"
Asian people look really stupid with blue contact lenses. Their brown eyes are so dark that the contacts just look like buttons sitting on their eyes.ï»¿
@Vibrating Cat  insecure?ï»¿
Yeah they are but I think it's more her actual look then the contacts. She's a beautiful actress.ï»¿
