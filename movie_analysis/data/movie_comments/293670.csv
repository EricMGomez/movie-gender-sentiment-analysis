Shaman was it all alongï»¿
"Thank you, how many time you had seen this til u understood this movie?ï»¿"
"I think the zombie is the devil switching bodies, and that the Japanese man was free from the evil spirit for a little and tried to hunt down the zombie. But as soon as he's free he is hunted by other men, and he cries at his misfortune in the woods. So when Jong-goo kills him its a sin. In short, the Japanese man is not evil but is possessed by the devil/devil takes his appearance.ï»¿"
Such a phenomenal movie though.ï»¿
"The shaman likely represents the evil of people, he is arrogant, and highly motivated by money.ï»¿"
"I believe the Japanese old monk was on the chase of the devil and finally met a strong devil worshiper in the young Shaman OR was an academic like the priest alluded to, and since he was a foreigner in the small rural mountainous village -- this made him a perfect target. Either way it was the young Shaman doing the evil bidding. Obviously this is about  the duality of good vs evil,  Young vs Old (Korean culture has a very youth orientated culture and brats are actually celebrated in thier society from what I've observed, but i could be wrong). Most old authoritarian figures in this film (with the exception of The Devil/Japanese dude) are either powerless or complacent (Captain, Grandmother & Priest). Overall, this was a great film.ï»¿"
Itâ€™s a great movie _Ÿ_¥ï»¿
the women in white says so herself that the shaman and the Japanese man are working togetherï»¿
"The Japanese man took the pictures of victims before their deaths and the shaman took the pictures after their deaths.I hope everyone understood everything by that.And Also, when you see the Japanese man in the end. He looks like a ""Jinn"".ï»¿"
You just read what was posted on reddit verbatim....ï»¿
Thanks for the analysis and explanation! Watched this movie last night and really enjoyed it. :)ï»¿
Very genius movieï»¿
Perfect explanationï»¿
"If the movie wasn't too long, i'd probably would've understood it  more instead of making us draw our own conclusions ..ï»¿"
"It is very good but my take on the film is that it is actually deeply Christian allegory which you don't specifically mention . The town is under attack because they have 'lost faith' exemplified most when the head priest is dismissive and mocking when policeman comes to him finally saying  'the church cannot help you'. So the town church itself has no faith.  The Woman in white is not just a good spirit, she is the embodiment of Jesus Christ. When we first see her she throws stones which is direct reference to the bible passage ""he who is without sin may cast the first stone' so when woman throws rocks at the policeman she must be Jesus because he is the only one who is 'without sin'. At the end when policeman asks her to give him proof, she asks him  to 'have faith' and to just 'believe', which echoes Jesus words when he says 'blessed are they who have not seen and yet believe'. She asks him to stand by her until the cock has crowed three times which again is direct reference to Peter in the bible who Jesus says will betray him before the cock has crowed three times. I think the movie has Christian message underneath it because the woman in white is Christ figure while the shaman are both evil although the Japanese one is the actual devil. Oh and the scene where Shaman is driving nails into the wood references the crucifixion and I think he is like Pilate or the Jews acting as agent of the devil. There's heaps more actually when you think about itï»¿"
Thank you for this! Brilliant! _Ÿ‘çï»¿
Different kind of scariness...itâ€™s another level. Damn i donâ€™t think i can fall asleep tonight. Thumbs up!ï»¿
This video does not help understand anything but mixes everything with almost seen details in the film.ï»¿
"Maybe you're confused.But whatever he said in this video is right.ï»¿"
Well explained.. thanksï»¿
"What does that even mean... @1:39 ""she without sin will cast the first stone"". It's not so obvious in the statement itself because if she was an ""angel"" or ""good"" then- why is she so weird when we first see her, - why was she whispering when her an the cop were inside the house,- why was she standing on top of the hill looking at the crashed car,- why does she wear the clothing of victims (is it before or after they're victims??)So much unanswered questions ....ï»¿"
"In the woman's first introductory scene, she's throwing stones at the police.ï»¿"
"Yeah I saw that scene, but WHY.ï»¿"
"@mrphangoldwing ""Let he who is without sin cast the first stone"" is a phrase from the bible regarding not judging people unless you yourself are pure.The phrase and her introductory scene are a clue that she is good/pure/angel?ï»¿"
we felt what protagonist felt!! that means its a damn good movie... at the end i also believed in shawman rather than white dress woman damn!!ï»¿
"TBH, when I watched this movie I don't know wth happened. Then I googled it, then it gave me goosebumps. It's not a typhical horror movie that will scare you. It was so deep that and well written.btw, the image of Japanese man in devil form is really scary.ï»¿"
"the shaman was a professional and was just doing magic like a business. he would have killed the man demon if he wasn't stopped by the fat cop. the ghost girl didn't like the shaman, because we was using black sacrificial magicï»¿"
The bugs scene in the shaman's car reminds me of pestilence like that in Moses. I think the angel had done it.ï»¿
"One thing I donâ€™t get it , devils use cameras ?ï»¿"
"the scene when the japanese man turned to the priest(?), ""Yes, it's me."" and took a picture of that guy. Still shook for several daysï»¿"
I like your video a lot ... can you please make a full complete explanation of this movie please!ï»¿
"I believe the two shamans were initially good but got possessed by the ghost in process of protecting the villagers. The Japanese was already possessed at the beginning of the movie, but he turned to his good nature when the Korean shaman performed the ritual. Because the ritual was not completed, the Korean shaman got slowly possessed by the ghost/evil spirit. The Japanese at the end was slowly dying due to his injury and the evil turned back to possesses him. while the Korean shaman was also slowly getting possessed by the evil spirit by the end. when he vomited while he's talking to the angel, it indicted the evil is already within him. The guardian woman cried at the end knowing this evil spirit was successful at manipulating the father.ï»¿"
"The japanese man curses people, and the shaman ""cures"" them for big amounts of money, good business strategy.ï»¿"
"The film really needs no explanation. Itâ€™s exactly as you thought. Itâ€™s a simple story but with manipulative editing and misleading direction to make you think it was something more than it is.I donâ€™t care that the film doesnâ€™t have a happy ending.I donâ€™t care that the film kept me guessing. In fact, I usually enjoy such films.This film fails because the story, the contrivances, and the editing lead to an ultimately unsatisfying conclusion.The Wailing left me thinking that I wasted my time caring about the protagonist.ï»¿"
I thought this movie sucked the Japanese  guy is the devil.When he takes pictures of the priest his eyes turn red and he starts growing hornsï»¿
"Absolutely fantastic breakdown of the film. I just watched this and was completely taken aback. I was shocked, tricked, and impressed beyond belief.ï»¿"
This is a bullshit explanation.ï»¿
"If you are here, then congratulations, you have a good taste in horror movies.ï»¿"
I really thought the woman was bad and the other two guys were good. Wow.ï»¿
That Japanese at the end looked so scary and realistic...far better than Hollywood horrors.ï»¿
"IMO. There's more than one demon. The trap was set for the Shaman, not the Japanese man. The Japanese man seemed like he had no intention of going to the house whatsoever. So suggests, the Shaman has a demon that is unique to him and is not simply just a human doing the Japanese man's bidding. He also proved hes a demon by vomiting in front of the white lady. I also feel that the family was always going to die regardless of what the main guy did, although she seemed benevolent, she also seemed very indifferent. Also, if you guys remember the two small photos of a bald old man with big beard next to the photo of a girl in the ritual room. I feel like these are photos of the Japanese man's vessel during his actual time, the female photo is harder to assume. Maybe the daughter of the real Japs human paradigm? Is she the woman in white? Either way, if you humour that road, it means theyve been doing this for a very long time, because those photos look very VERY old and sepia. Whenever he sees the white woman his facial expression suggests that they have an immense history which makes you think, okay this white woman isnt just some random spirit protecting the villiage, these 2 have history. I dunno, this movie is still tricky to nail down. But im quite satisfied with how I feel about it now after my 2nd viewing. Oh and I honestly feel that the Shaman was never good. He was always bad, the Park house murder scene kinda suggests that hes always been bad. Now, sure that off screen ritual could have been interrupted somehow too, but if you look closely it looks alot more intact than what happened when the main character raged and stopped the show at their ritual. The juicy Antichrist reference also enables soo much speculation that its insane. If the Japanese man is the Antichrist rather than Satan, then it suggests that revelation is on its way and the woman in white is a manifestation of Christ. If I use this theory then I feel that the moths were sent by Satan and not the Japanese man and yeah Im done. Anyway! Great movie.ï»¿"
"To those people who say the shaman was obviously and conciously evil, can they explain why after he encountered the girl spirit did he go back and pray for protection from Buddha? Doesn't seem very satanic or evil, at least intentionally, to act that out alone. The subtle hints to the shaman colluding with the devil are really powerful, but I think, reading some of the challenges in the comments, that the director definitley left some loose ends or inconsistencies.ï»¿"
"Good !! Its pretty hard movie to understand lol. 7:58 actually, the wood which has humen face is simbol of guardian in village in korea. Thent protect their village. Every village have that kind of wood in korea. I didnt expect the girl protect village becuz she looks so weak(my streotype) and BTW the girl in white is guardian in the villageï»¿"
This film is pantsï»¿
I'm not satisfy with the ending. They should make part 2 where they can solve and kill the monstersï»¿
Maria Jungkookie This ainâ€™t not like the American garbage Hollywood puts out. Ainâ€™t no happy ending in real life like hollywood makes you out to believe.ï»¿
"@FherKa19 well said, why watch a movie where you already know who dies or what will happen.ï»¿"
"exactly like Fherka19 said, this aint no hollywood bullshit, this movie makes u realize that in the real world there is always evil that is so strong that could ectually win, but u always have a choice, do u have faith or no, it is up to you to make the right move and change the world to better ;)ï»¿"
thank youï»¿
"I watched the movie in 2016 and it's 2018 but I still cant get over then I stumbled upon this video.I  appreciate your explanation since it's also what I believe after reading reviews and watching videos right after watching the movie.but I think on the part where the shaman was doing a ritual with the illusion of transitioning scenes from the shaman to the Japanese, some people are still not convinced since the Japanese was also hurting. Here's what I think (based from what I read from other people), the Japanese was hurting in his ritual because it was a fail ritual. He thought the guy on the car was dead so he decided to offer the guy's spirit to the devil using his photo. As seen on your video, there was a scene were the guy was still breathing. I believe the human should be dead before offering their soul that is why the ritual backfired to the Japanese which ended up hurting him and making the guy a zombie as seen on the later part of the movie.That's just some minor point I wanna share. I guess you were really hooked into this movie then u created a channel and just one video so you could do this explanation. lol but to be honest, you have great potential in making reviews and your voice suits this very well.. hope you do more! Subscribed!ï»¿"
You don't give the film any credit at all. Bullshit!!ï»¿
"I thought shaman was the main villain. And that Japanese man was just a random good guy trying to help the village. I was confused with the identity of the white dress girl. Damn I got it all wrong. Itâ€™s always opposite of what I think. My faith is thin like a paper. _Ÿ˜’ï»¿"
"Maybe someone can offer a better interpretation of this but in the Bible, Peter denied Jesus 3 times immediately before a rooster crowed. Similarly, the woman in white or the â€œangelâ€ù told the father to wait for the rooster to finish crowing 3 times before going back to the house, in order to give time for the shaman/demon to be trapped. Yet the father went into the house before the 3rd crow, thus â€œbetrayingâ€ù pure good as Peter did and letting evil/ human nature overpower him?ï»¿"
Man this movie was WILDï»¿
"craazy but amazing storyline, well written and well filmedï»¿"
"Fuck this shit man, to much going on. I prefer train to Busan, didn't need no explaining. Just straight up zombie movie, I don't wanna be working my brains out while watching a horror movie. Wailing didn't do much for me, sorry.ï»¿"
Thanks the explanation. It all makes sense now. Cheers!ï»¿
"I just finished watching this movie and I was so confused but now my head is clear. What really sticks to me the most is how at the end of the movie the Jap Man/Devil Figure says 'you see me as I am, why do you still feel doubt' or something like that. That quote I think corelates to the whole movie. The Jap Man is constantly being shown as an evil figure who constantly attacks people and is eating animals raw. He literally raped someone and and we're shown the scene when he calls the woman a filthy slut. Yet the father (and the audience who technically saw more  of the Devil's true self than the father) still doubt that he's evil. Not only that but even the shaman is given a few scenes that depict his connection to evil with the diaper and switching his clothes from white to black and constantly cussing and I'm sure many more. And the woman is constantly being displayed as a witness of sorts who's trying to show the truth. Innocent in all white, young with a soft voice. She never displays herself as violent or evil. Even in the end she only shows sadness and desperation but never anger or evil. Since the beginning of the movie the characters are displayed exactly as who they really are but the audience remains doubtful bc of the devil's clever tactics and his followers. But if we'd stayed faithful in the woman  and not underestimated the devil's plans we'd have seen everything from the beginning.ï»¿"
"Awesomw video pal, iave been searching for a true good explanations of this movie and i finaly got it. I agreed with everyting but iam not sure about only one, and that being the shamans ritual whether is taking damage to the japanese man or to the daughter, thats the key moment of the film and i think iam not fully convinced even right now what really hapenned there. Was tha shaman controling and trying to kill the girl or was he killing the devil? if he is trying to control and kill the girl that the movie makes much more sense and so i agree with you on everything else and we have pretty musch solve the mistery, but if in other hand the shamaÂ´s ritual is anything realted to the devil that theres my problem in getting it. The doubt keeps staying because if you see it many times i genuine believe the shaman is trying to kill the devil. Plus, with do the director would mix that two scenes that way, just with the simple and unique intention to confuse the viewer? thatÂ´s pretty lame for a movie and a director that good though, right?ï»¿"
"Great explanation brother, thank you!ï»¿"
"The Japanese is the ""God(Devil) in human form"" heavy reference of Jesus Christ. That is why he dies in car crash and comes back later in the cave with a hole in his hands.ï»¿"
Didn't like it being at 666 likes so I gave it another :P  .. Don't watch this movie and then check out a video explaining the movie that has only 666 likes.. JUST SAYINï»¿
Great movieï»¿
this film would be much better if it didnt have that underlying goofy tone for the first two hours. i may be wrong but i think that is just typical of korean cinema. train to busan was the same. i am not a fan of the flipping between goofy and series elements. it degrades the essence of the film imo.ï»¿
What about the white woman telling the father that he suspected the wrong man?ï»¿
"As a whole, Asians hate each other. Japanese believe themselves to be better than any other race, and since Japan shit kicked both China and Korea, and due to their culture and race bias, both of THEM hate the Japanese since the Japanese due to THEIR culture and race bias, committed some pretty heinous shit during the war.If you watch ANY Asian movie, all foreigners are the bad guys, only your own race are good guys unless they cooperate with outsiders and are uncle toms.Honestly, this movie just was predictable if you know anything about Asian cultures.They are all highly insular and clannish, and any kind of outsider or someone who sticks out even in their own societies tends to be immediately labeled the threat and shouted down or attacked if anything goes wrong.ï»¿"
"IMO..The woman in white is the village guardian or local diety who is good. She's wearing random objects from the villagers as a way of protecting them, but its a losing battle. At the end she broke down when the dad leaves to enter his house because it was the best chance to capture the demon but he ruins it. There's a small scene at the end where she just sits alone by the road dejected, she knew at that point her village is beyond saving. Still too many damn questions of this movie thoï»¿"
Yeah I wonder what's up with the shaman. Good or evil? If the shaman was working with the devil why did he hurt the japanese man with the ritual ? Way too many questions. Also why was the japanese man surprised when the corpse wasn't in the truck anymore and turned into a zombie. If he was evil shouldn't he be perfectly okay with that?ï»¿
Timmy Turner ...yes those two's motivations still confuse me. Pretty sure both are evil by then end of movie but not sure if they were from beginning or just possessed at some point.ï»¿
Timmy Turner alternate ending shaman picking up Japanese move out from Jong gu's villageï»¿
"+Rayray Apparantly the shamans ritual didn't hurt the japanese guy, it's the director who cut it that way to confuse people.ï»¿"
Why did the Japanese man almost die during the ritual?ï»¿
"the shaman had a nike jacket with adidas track pants, i knew he couldnt be trusted.ï»¿"
lolï»¿
Bwa ha ha. Why did I think the same thing tho!?! _Ÿ˜‚ï»¿

BIG FACTS lolï»¿
Whaaat I always mix Nike and adidas clothes!ï»¿
Krhodes02 you western spyï»¿
wordï»¿
I thought the same thing!ï»¿
it made no sense the woman in white demanded the man wait until the 3rd rooster crowï»¿
Great video analysis and such a good movie. I think the scene with the Shaman trying to expell the demon from the girl was interesting because we can see that the Japanese man is also hurt in the process. After the ending I was just left wondering why the woman in white wasn't more convincing when trying to get the man to trust her. Why did she have to sneak around all suspect the whole film? She could have just explained she was an angel and that she set the trap for the devil rather than acting as though she was an evil spirit. But I guess the point of the film would be to keep the viewers guessing and for the ending to be more revealing and creepy.ï»¿
"""Sinless casting the first stone"".That was what I need to hear.ï»¿"
Garbage movieï»¿
What about the stigmata? The devil shows holes in his handsï»¿
after watching this movie .. can I say my faith in Islam is increased ... this movie teaches us that the god is invisible but its existence is there if we look with the eyes of the heart .. that's what Islam teaches to his people ... thanks to the director..â_êâ_êâ_êâ_êâ_ê_Ÿ‘çï»¿
"Everything happened cuz the woman in white is a weak guardian diety. She can't really expect people to blinding believe her, she could had very been the evil one; for people to have blind faith, it has to be grounded in tradition and the tradition of worshipping local guardian dieties like her, as is common among ancient Asian traditions, has long since gone. Though her being weak is not really her fault, i suppose.I don't think the Japanese man is the devil or evil incarnate or anything, i think he is just a Japanese demon. Demons and Guardians Dieties are, in many ways, the same; he invade her territory and she failed to defend it.ï»¿"
This is reason why I don't want to live in rural area or in the forest.ï»¿
I JUST finished watching this movie and needed some answers. Thank you!!ï»¿
Great explanationï»¿
Thanks for the analysis. It's great! I really couldn't make much of it - now it's much clearer. Maybe some day I'll watch it again.ï»¿
"You didn't make emphasis on how both the Japanese men/ the shaman are physically weak and dreadful of the mere presence of the Woman(angel).This is seen on the mountain scene,when the Japanese men runs from her and eventually get run over by the truck, while the rituals are taking place is is revealed at 7:23 that she was the cause of the Japanese man chest pains and of course the shaman gushing out blood . Also,after the murder at the house of Park Chun-bae's house we see they've held a ritual with the shaman too,from which no one survivedï»¿"
"I think the shaman was working for the jap man only because he was providing him with more victims that he could make money out of ,if I'm not mistaken apart from the 10 million  he took for the exorcism he also took some more money later in the film from the mother of the girl, before the jap man was hit by the car.ï»¿"
"zero sympathy for the father,  stupid as fuck, if ur gonna have a kid it takes more than yelling and cause havoc. the film also make the audience think rational show us how to think calmly and not just get into shock all the time. in the first part that cop saw the photos yet he did nothing, then the fat fuck of a father went and asked the demon to leave then fucked his house up... what a retard. anyways glad all this shit happened to the father, great actingï»¿"
"The woman is the devil. The film is very crafty and tricky about its meaning but i think that the woman is the evil spirit and the Japanese man was fighting her. Much like the devil the film lays many traps to lead us astray and come to a false conclusion. We see him alone (when he had no reason to act falsely since there's no one to trick) acting in ways that the demon would never behave in: looking genuinely concerned when the dead man in the car wasn't there (his ritual was to prevent possession but he was interrupted; had he been the devil he would have been happy the man got possessed) and looking scared when he was being hunted. He was collecting photos of the deaf people to prevent them from turning into zombies. It was only after being killed that the evil spirit finally possessed him. That he's Japanese is not random: it's well known that many Koreans aren't exactly fond of Japanese people. The director chose a Japanese actor to show how easily people are tricked and led astray by their own biases and unfounded beliefs. On the flipside no one would believe evil to be a pretty young girl in white.Overall brilliant movie. Love how many interpretations there are of it.ï»¿"
Kagemusha08 u didn't understand the movie dudeï»¿
"You're delusional dude, watch the bloody movie before spewing your political bullshit. First of all, the Japanese man is possessed by the Devil. This is clearly shown at the ending of the movie when the priest goes to confront the Japanese man and the Devil reveals himself. In fact this ending scene is the most clear scene in the entire movie. This does not mean the Japanese man is bad. He is in fact possessed, and in some parts of the movie we see the Japanese man crying in pain and suffering because of the possession. The Shaman is also possessed, used as a tool to act like he is a good guy when in fact his rituals are actually offering the souls of the villagers to the Devil. The Shaman also sometimes becomes normal like the Japanese man despite being possessed (goes to Buddah temple to ask for help). The whole mechanic of possession and how the possessed people sometimes win over the possession by the Devil is what makes the movie so confusing. The true protagonist in the movie is the woman in white, the ghost. She is trying to protect the village. The fact that she wears white is a huge clue : Koreans (and many other cultures) represent white as being good and black to mean death. When she also makes the Shaman puke blood (hurting the possessing demon) disrupting the sacrifice ritual of the young girl it becomes clear that the ghost is the protagonist.ï»¿"
I would've tought the same until the point you see literally the Japanese turning into a demon. Till this point the movie tries to keep make it ambiguous .ï»¿
"The woman is not evil. The Japanese man and the shaman were the evil. Didn't you see the Japanese man take the pictures of the victims before their death and the shaman take the pictures after their death.The policeman's family wouldn't have been dead if he had trusted the woman.ï»¿"
"@JOSE CANAL Remember, the Japanese shaman is hit by a car and very likely killed at the end of the movie. This lets the woman possess him, hence why, in one of the last scenes, the Japanese shaman can show himself as the devilï»¿"
Ni_Ÿ…±_Ÿ…±a thiccï»¿
"I disagree with you because During the Shaman ritual the Japanese man is also hurt by the nails in the stomachThe woman in white is not necessarily good because she prevented the main character from going home and saving his daughter in time. The main character waiting for the 3 crows wouldn't have made any difference in regards to saving his family. All together its a very confusing film...ï»¿"
"Count Yorga she prevented him going into the house, because she laid a trap at the front door of the house.And when he ignores her and goes in anyway, we see the trap shrivel up. He explained this in the video.ï»¿"
"disagree to agree againIt was part of the movie's brilliant transitioning to mislead the audience that the Shaman's ritual was hurting the Japanese. It was explained in this video and it can be seen in the movie that the Japanese was having another ritual with the guy on the photo.It was not anymore about saving his daughter , it was already about capturing the evil spirit to save the town.It was a Test of Faith as explained on the video. The ""3 crows"" is a reference to Peter denying Jesus on the 3rd crow. In the movie, the Father failed the test and did not wait for the 3rd crow and went to the house thus nullifying the trap on the gate for the evil spirit. Yes, it's suppose to create confusion that is why it's so good.ï»¿"
"The Japanese is an ONI. An ogre, demon in the japanese folklore. They are the masters of the thunder. We see the thunder many times in the film. Some ONI are red, blue or yellow.  The young shaman, when he has a jacket, his jacket is cleary blue. And the Japanese, we see him many times his face full of blood, which makes him look red. A master red ONI and his blue ONI stooge.ï»¿"
wow thanks for postingï»¿
"Hey dude , are you planning to make more videos about movies ? You have a lot of potential!ï»¿"
I'm not sure if this was mentioned but the Shaman and The Japanese Man are both taking pictures with the same Minolta camera.ï»¿
"Angel says to the cop to enter the house only after 3 rooster sounds. But when he enter the house after two rooster sounds already his mother and wife is dead and his daughter is in front of the house. How it is possible? And when he enters the room he saw his mother and wife died long time ago. If angel is true he must saw the killing of his wife and mother atleast he can hear their last words, but not, they already died long time ago. That's where the confusion.ï»¿"
"the angels was not a angel she is the real evil ghost. the japenese samman was taking pictures and doing rituals to prefent dead bodies getting possed, you can see he failed because the other samman tought he was the evil and did a ritual to kill the japenese samman but in the end the police guy stopped him. thats why the japenese samman survived  but afther the police hit him with a car and threw him of the clif he was dead but no one took a picture of the japenese samman to stop him from getting his dead body possesed. thats why you see him as a evil in the end because he was possesed by that time and the trap the girl talked about in te end was for the other samman who went there with is car but luckely the police guy broke the trap which made it possible for the samman to get in that home with out getting possesd you also see pictures falling out of his car thats because sammans use pictures for their rituals to stop dead people form getting possesed.ï»¿"
The movie made more sense after listening to your explanation.ï»¿
"The director provides what it seems to be an important clue to the hands of the devil at the end of the movie in a cave with his ""how can a spirit have flesh and bones"" speech. There is another scene where the angel grabs the protagonist's hand which proves that she is not a spirit...or does it? As an audience, we try to understand the movie's plot with evidence provided. In that scene in the cave, it was a manipulative devil, who happens to feed on people's faith towards him (or lack of on the opposite side) to empower himself. I'm used to ""oh, it's about that time they reveal the twist to the plot"" scenes in many other movies that I never ask myself who is providing the evidence to the plot. Did I believe the devil's lies as an evidence to the movie plot? Does that mean I had more faith in the devil throughout the movie? Was I empowering the devil when I did? What does that make me? When I asked myself these questions, I had goosebumps like I never had one before. A powerful movie.ï»¿"
Could not have been explained or said any better.. bravo.. moreï»¿
"""let him that is without sin cast the first stone""ï»¿"
Is that why the (good ?) sprit threw stones at him in the beginning?ï»¿
Thnx brother.. Past one week thinking about ths movie climax.. Mystery ending.. Saw another video its says the movie ending was not like tht has some more scenes and the director cut it short.. If it was there will get some more clarity at my first watch.. First tym was confused about the movie ending.. Now a happy face from my side _Ÿ˜_ï»¿
Best movieï»¿

Japanese man lives as a hermit in the Korean countryside, and the Korean locals are suspicious of him !? If that doesn't scream RED HERRING, I dunno what does... And in the end, the Japanese man turns out to be Literally, The Devil! It's not clever. It's too... on the nose. Maybe Korean audiences found it mind-blowing, but...ï»¿"
I'd would like to rewatch the movie again to confirm all of your theories but this time I will invite other friends to join with me because I can't suffer it alone once again. The movie was so good yet so intense!!!!ï»¿
"I actually saw this film as an analysis of evil. Everyone is evil in this film. The Japanese man is pure evil, but everyone else is also evil. The girl in white may be good, but she was still not excused from her evil acts. Same with our main character, who went to kill an elderly man. Even though this elderly man was evil itself, the main character pre-meditated an attack, which is also evil.That's how I saw it. Not as a film of good and evil, but a film about evil alone.PS I still loved the video _Ÿ‘çï»¿"
Are you a catholic?ï»¿

"well the main character was a nice guy, but he gradually  gets wasted, so someone like him failing the test it's prove that everything is corrupted and the Jap/Devil won the battle.ï»¿"
Yeah but what can You say about the love of daughter and father? The first scene of the film is about their bonding and the end is her father remembering her. Might be all evil but still have a little good in itï»¿
"Great explanation. This movie totally got to me. It seemed like a confusing jumbled mess at first. I wasn't scared at all. It slowly worked it's magic, adding on a layer here, a layer there. Before I knew it, at the very end, I was so terrified and disturbed... LOL. This is DEEP scary. Zombie movies are surface tip of the iceberg scary. This one gave me nightmares lol.ï»¿"
The demon did a ritual to create a zombie to protect himself from the group of cops that showed up to go kill him. Thats why the zombie exist and he was watching to see if the zombie did kill the cops. he later got caught after the cops killed the zombie and they all chased him. Knowing that the demon exist the ghost lady protects the village by leading the demon down the mountain and into the road where the cops swerved the truck hitting him. the ghost lady is protecting the village from both the demon and the shaman (who is evil and perform rituals for money and stealing souls with photos).ï»¿
"The shaman wasn't leaving the town. the shaman was heading back to the cops house where the girl was to claim her soul. The ghost girl made the shaman hallucinate the bird poop on his windshield to stop him from coming to the cops house. She said that the evil one is coming to his house, which the shaman said he is meeting the cop at the cops house to get his daughter. at the end the shaman arrives at the cops house to take the pictures.ï»¿"
"At the end the demon killed the priest in self defense as the priest came to the cave with the intention of killing the demon by bringing a sickle with him as killing weapon. Demon never killed anyone wrongfully in the movie. He let the guy go who saw him eating a dead animal. The demon was just caught in the crossfire of the evil deeds of the shaman guy who is using the tonic killings as an excuse to perform his rituals for money from the towns folks. The ghost lady was telling the cop at the end that the sin the cop commited was that he falsely accused an innocent person of a crime that they did not commit. The cop accused the demon (japanese guy) of making the towns folks kill their own family members, which is not true as that was the work of the health tonic made from mushrooms. That was his sin and price he paid for at the end. The ghost girl was trying to tell him the entire time that the shaman was the evil one, thats why she confronted the shaman at his house near the end of the movie.ï»¿"
"1.Why then Jong-goo's daughter's shoe was found at the Old Japanese guy's house?2.She denies that it was her shoe but she also accepts that she had met the old Japanese guy.3.also when the white mysterious woman and Jong-goo is talking at the end she tells him that what he saw was no dream.Can you please explain how these three points prove old Japanese guy innocent?But the white mysterious woman also says that Jong-goo has committed a sin by wrongly accusing and trying to kill Old Japanese guy.Why is all this so confusing???_Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜_ï»¿"
"The shaman was trying to blame the ghost girl (the good person in the movie) as the culprit of the murders and the possesion of his daughter, which is not true. She said that the one who is behind it all is coming to his house. The one person going to his house at that moment is the shaman guy saying he will meet with the cop at his house to save his daughter. When he walked past the front door with the herbs hanging on top it tripped the trap the ghost lady set for the shaman guy. thats how he can get inside his house after his daughter kills everyone to take the pictures.ï»¿"
and with the pictures the Jap can create some kind of zombie?ï»¿
"The demon itself did not kill the man who saw it eating a dead corpse of an animal, he was alive and well after seeing the japanese man in red eyes aka the demon. the demon let him go and later he told the cops where he found him at and that there is a house. That house was used by the Shaman and the demon happen to live near by inside a cave. He went there at same time as the 2 cops to maybe talk to the shaman guy about collecting souls for him. Cops confronted the demon in japanese man form and destroyed the house with the pickaxe. demon didnt care since its not his house. The shaman later on went back to the house to collect his pictures to hide the evidence leading to him be part of the murders from the tonic drinks.ï»¿"
The health tonic which was made from mushrooms is whats causing people to go crazy killing their family members. It was said in the news on tv. also proven when the guy who got struck by lightning wife said that he drank all those health tonic only to be hit by lightning which is the irony in it. His cop friend also drank the tonic too and near the end was found killing his family. The priest saw that crime scene about the tonic and wanted to find out if what they killed was really a demon or a ghost. He went to the cave to confirm it and found out its a demon and not a ghost.ï»¿
"Damn I feel so stupid cause I didn't get that many things from the plot, thanks, but in my defense I would say it's a deliberately confusing movie made with rewatchability in mind but just too damn long for repeated views if you don't have the time.ï»¿"
"I think that the shaman an the demon have a mutualistic relationship. The demon terrorizes the people and kills his victums, while the shaman makes money for ""exorcising"" the afflicted. Then takes pictures foe the demon.ï»¿"
one of the best movie i have ever seen...ï»¿
"I think the Jap shaman's ritual was actually to prevent the dead bodies from getting possessed by other spirits. If he wanted to create zombies, then he would've already created an army seeing all the photos he has taken and rituals he has performed. The guy in the car became a zombie because the Jap shaman's ritual failed. Why? The other shaman's ritual was directed to the Jap shaman. Japanese dude got hurt while he was doing the anti-possession ritual. 'Other shaman' was MISLEAD when he asked ""Did your daughter meet someone she wasn't supposed to?"" Jonggoo tells him about the Japanese man and believes it. At the final scene, the other shaman wasn't shocked and took the photos because its their job, theyre both shamans... they take photos of dead bodies and perform rituals to prevent them from getting possessed. Y'all probably wondering why the Japanese guy looked like that at the end. Well when they killed and threw him off the hill, no one was there to protect his soul from getting possessed & so he did. He was human before tho. He was scared shitless and even cried while he was being chased. If he was already the devil before he couldve just killed everyone.This video explanation isn't the best imo.. left out some details.. More details here tho: https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/69vp0j/the_wailing_2016_comprehensive_analysis_and/ï»¿"
"woah it's amazing, that makes more sense to me!!!ï»¿"
Then what's the woman's role in this?ï»¿
the woman was the evil ghost the reason she said dont go to your home is because the trap was for the shaman who was in his car on his way to that place but in the end he went to his home because of that the trap was broken because of this the shaman could go inside with out getting possesd  the reason you see all the pictures falling out of his car is because shamans use pictures to prefent the women (ghost) to posses them  if the father went to his home before the first sound he could have saved his familyï»¿
"this interpretation would make sense but the mere fact that the movie had an alternate ending supporting the common theory that the woman in white is good and the shamans are evil makes me think that, that's what the people making this movie intended.ï»¿"
emre Unal aï»¿
"Japanese Man- Is possessed by a demon, sometimes he's normal and sometimes he's not. As a human, he doesn't want to be possessed and tries to keep the Demon inside him locked away. While he's human, it takes a form all on its own away from him, it terrorizes people. When he goes to sleep, loses focus, etc. Shaman- Works for the Demon/Japanese man and loves money, also kinda evilWoman in white- Angel/Good Spirit/ProtectorThe Japanese man died, the Demon took over the Japnese mans physical form as well as mental. Demon takes pictures to keep their souls and eat them, to live long. The Demon probably decided it might want the little girls form next cuz shes youthful and has a long life.ï»¿"
KytKuma I totally believe this theory (and want to believe that this is what really happened).ï»¿

Thank you for making this video. I wasn't smart enough to truly understand the film. This explained everything!ï»¿
"Its very clear, the ending. The lady is good, the Japanese man is bad and the shaman is indirectly or in a different way bad also because without the shaman, the family wouldâ€™ve survived.ï»¿"
"The shaman is evil from the beginning. It's strange to me that people misinterpret this. They do not take all the evidence into play and only bring in a select number of points to support their argument. There are many other supporting reasons as to why the shaman was evil from the beginning and it is not only because he wore the same diaper as the evil Japanese man (which no one disputes he was not evil to begin with since the director himself said he was). So, first as to why the shaman was evil to begin with. 1. We see early in the movie when the policeman goes to the Jap's house the 2nd time, all the pictures of the victims (which represents their souls) were gone. At the very end of the movie, we see the shaman has all of them in a box he kept in the trunk of his car. 2. When the policeman's daughter got possessed, she became extremely foul mouthed and would cuss and swear. The first thing we hear the shaman say has a curse word in it. The shaman continues to show foul language throughout the movie which indicates parallel to the possessed girl. Think about it, would someone holy, curse? Furthermore, the woman in white (representing Christ as said by the director) never swears. 3. The shaman was wearing the same diaper as the Jap man. But people overlook something in that scene. When the shaman is talking about the ritual that is to come and what will happen, he is wearing white. However, after he is done he goes to change his clothes while the policeman is still there. When the shaman removes his clothes the director chooses to show the shaman in the same diaper as the Jap man. Not only that, but the shaman proceeds to dress in all black. This would show the dual double faced nature of the shaman. From wearing complete white when talking about his shaman responsibilities, but reverting to wearing all black when he is not needed to 'act' as a shaman. 4. When the shaman was doing the ritual, the scene was paralleled with the Jap man doing his own ritual to offer the souls of the dead victims to the Devil. They both had an erratic, eccentric, and gibberish filled ritual. Both made use of sacrificing chickens and using their blood. The movie would cut from the shaman erratically waving an instrument around the air yelling gibberish, to the Jap man banging his drum erratically and frantically while mumbling gibberish. Furthermore, when the ritual was almost complete, the daughter, who for the entire time she was possessed did not speak to anyone (esp her father) in a normal way, says ""Dad"". So right when the shaman was about to cast the final step in removing the daughter's soul, she pleas with her father in her normal voice and pattern of speech for the first time since her possession. The fact that she calls out ""Dad"" is very important as she never addressed him in this way after her possession. Thus, the ritual got cancelled (as the dad messed it up once the daughter said that) and the girl did not have her soul removed. She is still possessed though as the shaman was doing the ritual to remove her soul not the demon inside her. 5. The shaman puked out blood and puke when the woman in white came near him. She told him to ""get out"" and the shaman, weakened (shown through his physical fatigue and heavy panicked breathing), goes back to his shrine (which he went to and used near the beginning of his time as shaman in the movie) and attempts to re-evil himself by performing his erratic gestures with his instrument, this time on himself, and lighting candles. However, one of the candle lights go out and he looks shocked by it. He is also further prevented from going to the policeman's place by having bird droppings fall onto his car windshield. These are the main evidence as to why the shaman was evil from the beginning. Any questions please ask.ï»¿"
Kate Kim my only question is about the ritual. It seems the goal of all these past instances were to have the family killed. If he removed the sould from the daughter and killed her wouldn't that defeat the purpose? Unless you're saying his shaman ritual was to remove the soul but to keep the living alive and well for murder I guess that makes sense. Just wanting to clarify cause you really seem to have a better grasp on it than me.ï»¿
"Thanks, can you also explain why good spirited girl didnt want dad to go to his house and possibly save his family from daughterï»¿"
"but if the shaman was evil,why was he having a statue of buddha and was asking buddha for help....hes evil right..how could buddha help him if he is evilï»¿"
"you mentioned a few great hints there! thanks for that. two minor additions:1. it was not bird droppings but insects (i think moths or more fittingly locusts)2. yes, he was working with the devil, but he was not really evil himself.on reddit i read that the woman is depicting jesus/god (she  while the japanese is depicting the devil. well, i think he's just posessed by the devil which is a detail that explains his behaviour throught the movie, like being scared of the policeman and his friends. he's depicting judas, i believe, which would be very fitting (i have no idea why i have not seen anyone else making this point yet). that's why he was trying to flee and turned back after he had the illusion on the highway. maybe he realised that there is no escaping from the devil. i'm not sure on this one but he was clearly trying to escapeï»¿"
"Himesh Thungaturthi because in that point he was not in possession of evil...he was ""free"" for a while...the puke shows that the evil is going out. But insists on him at the end.ï»¿"
"i think when the shaman throws up & has all the blood come out near the woman, she expelled the evil from him. i think he was possessed by evil. with the evil gone he immediately goes back to his shaman place to try to purify himself, but the ritual was interrupted by evil. so then he tries to leave town but is stopped and forced again to do the evil biddingï»¿"
Where did you read the director saying the young woman represents christ?ï»¿
"To my understanding, the Jap and shaman want to go around and curse one member of a family to become possessed and go on a killing spree on the other family members. Once the daughter got cursed (remember the scene where the father's policeman friend gave the daughter's shoe to him - the shoe found in the Jap's home), it takes time for her to be completely possessed (as the daughter's soul still dwells in her body). If the shaman removed the soul of the daughter, the only remaining ""entity"" inside the body of the daughter would be an evil entity like a demon, which would then be able to go on and murder the rest of the family members.  But yes, you're right in saying that the ritual was to remove the daughter's soul, so that her body could become fully possessed.ï»¿"
"The woman in white (good spirited girl) had cast a spell to ""trap"" the demon that was dwelling inside the daughter's body. For the spell to work, the father had to stay out of the house. Basically, this concept of ""don't go into the house and the spell will work"" was put into place because it's supposed to go in parallel with Christianity - where Christians are supposed to put ""blind faith"" into Christ to be saved. You can see in the scene where the father doesn't listen to the woman in white and runs back to his house, the camera pans into the assortment of floral trinkets on top of the house's opening doors. The floral trinkets are the physical part of the spell. Once the father enters the house, the director shows us that the flowers - that were completely alive and healthy - withered. That just shows the spell failed as the father had no faith in the woman in white and went against what she advised. Hope that explains it.ï»¿"
"One thing to take note of is that this movie can be seen parallel with themes in Christianity (confirmed by the director as well). In Christianity, 'there is only one true God'. Thus, Buddha would have no actual standing in the movie as Buddha would be seen as 'not real' and Buddhism a 'fake religion'. So, with these in mind, the interpretation for why the shaman had a Buddha statue is:Shamanism is an actual practice, and there are shamans in real life. The shaman in the movie, however, is in alliance with the Jap - who is the devil (as seen in the ending of the movie where the Jap reveals himself to be the devil to the deacon). Thus, the shaman is not a ""true"" shaman. He is only using shamanism as a front so that he can infiltrate chosen homes and do the devil's bidding. Note that the 'devil' I mention here is the devil in Christianity. So, the shaman is not actually asking Buddha for help - he is just putting on a show.ï»¿"
"That could be a good interpretation as well. In my opinion, I think the shaman was evil throughout the entire movie and in no point in time was he ""cleansed"". For the scene where the shaman throws up, I believe it is because he, an evil spirit, came in contact with holiness. In Christianity, there are multiple verses that support the notion that the darkness hates the light. Just one verse to give an example would be John 3:20 - Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. Thus, as the 'evil' shaman 'hates' the 'light', when he came into contact with it or was ""exposed"", he showed physical repulsion. In my eyes, it is sort of like when you're living in the dark for so long, once you come out to the light, your eyes and skin burn - basically have a negative physical reaction. For the ritual, the way the shaman performed it was reminiscent of his ritual on the daughter (which was trying to expel her soul) and the ritual the Jap man did as well. They were both erratic and chaotic, with mumbling, gibberish, and loud/distracting instruments. So I see the ritual as trying to ""re-evil"" himself.ï»¿"
"Kate KimÂ  I'd like to rebut by saying that the Korean shaman was actually a netural party at the very beginning, but was under the influence of the devil after the father interrupted his death hex. The Japanese shaman was, of course, under the influence the entire time, but was severely weakened by the death hex, which is how the devil was removed from him and thus was able to ""possess"" the Korean shaman. And I also believe that both the Shamans are never actually fully ""possessed"" during the movie, but are only ""influenced"" (like a voice in their heads) by the devil, because the devil does not have full power/control yet. This is why we see the Japanese shaman showing very human-like emotions in certain scenes (buying the chickens before his ritual; being chased by Jong-gu's mob). He is very aware of his actions, but is unable to do anything to stop it. That's why he looks so defeated after Jong-gu comes to his house and kills his dog. He knows that he has to continue the devil's bidding, despite him not wanting to actually do any of it.As well, I'd like to think that the shamans and rituals we see during the other murders are done by other shamans. I don't believe that the Korean shaman would come to this small village for every person in the town. That's why the Mother-In-Law says that he's the best one. I don't think every person (especially because Jong-gu looks to be the most well-off of the victims) could afford his services.Furthermore, at the very end, we see the devil in his true form, which is why he was shown as the Japanese shaman - because we are seeing him through the perspective of the young Deacon. He goes there with conviction, knowing that the Japanese shaman was evil all along. But after Jong-gu throws the physical Japanese shaman's body over the cliff, he committed a mortal sin, thus giving the Devil enough strength to become a physical being - or at least physical enough to appear in front of the Deacon. This is why, at the end in the cave, we see the ""shaman"" aka the Devil, with holes in his hands to essentially fuck with the deacon.Lastly, the ending where the Korean shaman had his evil ""expelled"" by the woman in white, he had realized that he was ""free"" from the devil, which is why he went back to his home and prayed to keep the devil away, but the devil is still sending omens because he still has some control over the Korean shaman. When he sees the crow and tries to drive away, the Devil sends a swarm of locusts to his car. He knows now that he cannot escape the devil and he must become his new pawn to do his bidding, since the Japanese shaman was physically killed.ï»¿"

That's great man. I was so confused during the movie. I was 100% on trusting the Shaman so even in the end I couldn't see him as the bad guy. But I fully agree with your interpretation now. I'd love for u to put out more content in your video. Well pointed about the cloth the shaman wears haha I thought it was sooooo sketchy but made nothing of it.ï»¿
"Well no shit sherlock. The question is what the hell was the shaman exorcising?!! the good or evil spirit?   How did the japanese guy get briefly exorcised? Did the good spirit trick the shaman to hurt the japanese? if so how? The other 4 victims, where their exorcism performed on them too? There seems to be evidence in the film from the crime scenes but never confirmed. What happens to the victims is no exorcism is performed, do they still die like the guy in the hospital? Are these just plot holes? oh the most annoying missing information is WTF is the devil trying to do anyways? have the victims go insane murder family so he can take a picture then the corpse (after a black feather chicken ritual) turn into a fucking zombie? Are you fucking kidding me? But all that aside, if we just focus on the main character how his mistrust, suspicion, weak deductive logic lead to the killing of an innocent (at least not proven guilty) man, the movie is very fulfilling.ï»¿"
"1. shamans exorcism was to remove soul of child therefor solidifying posession2. shamans little dance didnt hurt jap guy, director said in interview these events didnt actually happen at the same time. they were just cut together that way to show they are doing very similar rituals (mumbling about and killing chickens) what hurt jap man was white lady approaching (who is a spirit protecting the village)3. devil doesnt just want ppl to go insane and have their photos. he wants their souls and the shaman offers these souls to jap man after exorcising them (extracting souls leaving behind a demon posession) btw jap guy is also only posessed by the devil, he himself is still human and at times his human self emerges. like in the chase scene where he hurt himself.you asked these questions 8 month ago but i still hope you are happier now with these answersï»¿"

"I too wanted to know what people thought of it, even though I think it's pretty self-explanatory.The deacon literally meets the Devil himself,face to face,at his lair(already a pretty good guarantee that he's not gonna make it out) The deacon drops the sickle and listens to the Devil. Lastly the Devil takes a picture of the deacon,just like the Japanese men/Shaman did with prior victims.ï»¿"
"THE WHAT!!> UNTIL NOW IM STILL SUCK OF THINGKING ABOUT THIS MOVIE.BUT ALL I CAN SAY THE WOMAN THEY SEE IS A REAL GHOST BUT THIS SHAMAN IS JUST TRICKING THEM TO MAKE MONEY ALL OF THE VILLAGER PEOPLE AND HE MAKE USE ""THE JAPANESE OLD MAN"" AND PUT ALL THE BLAME TO THAT OLD JAPANESE WHO IS SUSPECTED AS A MONSTER IN THEIR VILLAGE WHICH IS TRUE.ï»¿"
"The Shaman gave himself away, ' I'm going to cast a death-hex'. That is not what i want to here, period.ï»¿"
"Hey, Please Can you review "" I saw the devil"" / "" Secret Sunshine""?ï»¿"
"Thanks but no.. here's the facts and explanation about the movie. we are all deceived by the director's brilliant method. The movie in fact, tells us something totally different. There are no real evil or angels or ghosts in this movie except the ones that the director wanted us to see. The culprit of all the mysterious killings are because of the poisonous mushrooms. Remember the little pigs in the first scene, blood test results and the Chinese medicines made from the mushrooms (soup thingy) ? Which means many of villagers have eaten the mushroom infected animals or either directly consumed it. The movie keeps telling us about the poisonous mushroom and its hallucination effects time to time. But we miss this every time because we are too focused on the mysterious force, in this case, the ghosts or its force.  Remember what the priest said when they visited him? He said why they believe something without proof? Just sit back and believe what the doctor tells you. This is pretty much ironical coming from a priest but it's the fact. Hyo-jin actually gets better but her grandmother actually gave her the chinese medicine soup again. (in case you missed it) and she gets bad again. And also when the zombie came out, no one seemed to know who it was even though it is very small village where everyone knows everyone. However they believed she got better because they killed the japanese guy. Let's talk about this Japanese guy. He is an outsider living in the village and turned out that he was a shaman as well. However everyone thinks he's onto something evil, suspicious and mysterious and say bad things about the guy. This actually grow bad thoughts among villagers which made protagonist actually believe he had something to do with his daughter's illness. So during the entire movie, we all believe shamans would do the job so that everyone gets well making everyone miss out the real reason why this is happening. The fear, mistrusts, beliefs, and wrath are the ones that the director really wanted to show in the movie. Every dialogues that they had with the ghosts are all different and very ambiguous. Yes, People believe what they want to believe even though that belief is distorted and somewhat sick. and sometimes people don't believe what they are doing is wrong and keep doing it. and they are trapped by it. That's the real meaning that the director wanted to show and it was successful because we believed in it without trying to believe the facts. This is the by far most brilliant movie i ever encountered in korean movie history.ï»¿"
I don't believe you.  I need some proof please. =Pï»¿
that doesnt hold up as much for me because i have a hard time believing the director would base the whole movie around such subtleties while the subject we are seeing for most of the film has almost no meaning.ï»¿
Dude You are just completely out of track i suggest you to watch the movie again because you missed too many detailsï»¿
"Android if this was a school project to anaylze the film, you'd get an F lol, youre way off track, lay off the shrooms boyï»¿"
"yea , definitely a no. You glossed over some major plot points. Pictures , why pictures. There is definitely demon stuff in this , not euphemism or metaphors or anything .ï»¿"
"LOL that would mean 99.9% percent of the scenes in the film are hallucinations. Sure you can go ahead and believe that but it is not supported by...99.9% of the movie. Eye roll. The subject of trust, murder, fear...etc are still conveyed without the entire village on shrooms.ï»¿"
"So, how do you explain the appearance of the Japanese man towards the end of the movie? Was the Deacon on shrooms as well?ï»¿"
maybe the whole village really was under the influenceof the mushrooms. they probably ate the animals which came from the village so most of them had in someway some mushroom substances in their systems.ï»¿
+lena ponpon Its not as if when you eat an animal you are eating the shroom the animal ate as well. The shroom is already processed by the animal so that its effect will not be felt by the man easting the animal.ï»¿
well i like that take but i wish the movie have dropped more hints about the shrooms of other viral infection .ï»¿
"I think it's worth pointing out that there is a lot of emphasis on eating in the movie. The first scene is the mother-in-law prodding that dad to eat something before he leaves. The daughter urges the dad to take a sip of her drink. He eats some kind of meat when he visits his gossipy friend's shop. When the dad and pal cop go to a restaurant the camera lingers on the meat cooking. The dad eats something while they wait in front of the house where he meets the spirit woman. The shaman's rituals seemed to always involve meat, dead pigs specifically (at the protag's house and one of the crime scene where it appears a similar ritual took place). A crow was found in the soy sauce. Chicken foot soup is found at the Japanese man's house. The Japanese man is repeatedly pictured eating a dear carcass. Before the little girl murders her family she gorges herself on food. Not saying believe this theory, but I always appreciate a new lens to look at interesting movies. And holy shit, there were so many parts with food that I hadn't thought about until I started listing them :Bï»¿"

"First of all my English is very bed. so hopefully you guys understand what I`m saying. I`m Korean by the way. And this is not my opinion. Just based on director`s interview.The woman - Here in Korea, we have a old superstition that every each area have a ghost who protect people`s village. We called it ""Tochack-ryung"" witch means ghost who stick in the land.So she is kind of good ghost. She wants to protect her village from the evil. this is why she was wearing victim`s stuff like cloth, hairpin.Shaman - He just cooperator of Japanese man. he trick the village`s people. and make them easy to curse.Japanese man - He is possessed by a evil. sometimes he just a normal person and this is why he was crying at the cliff scene.+ the shaman is performing the ritual, the Japanese man is also suffering - Director said from the interview. That was not a same time event. He wants to make audience little bit confuse. And there are some cut scenes.(off screen) check the link down below.anyway this movie has quite simple story line but director cut and slice scenes and mix it together and it makes this movie more hard to understand. Based on Director Hong-jin, Na`s interview : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGWyxLqslIo (Korean)Cut scenes : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62bt5ZdRJ7w (begin at 0:43, 1:54)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ (January 25, 2018)Another ending full version : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99cptKygQhgIf you watch this clip, you can see what was going on more clearly. The reason why director did't use this ending it's bc he wants to make this movie more open ending and I think it actually work correctly.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+(August 27, 2018)former ending link is missing so use new link here : https://youtu.be/mz11vq7WAc4I found another cut scene : https://youtu.be/uD7FaNA3R50subtitle (1:41) young priest - I need to pee (3:24) Japanese man - Did you see the girl who wear white dress?(3:28) Jong-gu - Who are you? huh? who are you?(3:46) Young priest - What's going on right now? Do you have any idea what is going on?(3:49) Jong-gu - Shut the fxxx your mouth. Sang-bok... Sang-bok (name)ï»¿"

BLACKOUT thanks! I'll check it outï»¿
"Muradin 83 i am a horror fan from korea. I recommend u R-point and old films of kim ki young. Housemaid, insect woman....ï»¿"
koreanlovelygirl no never heard of them. I will check them out. Thank you very much!ï»¿
koreanlovelygirl I have looked for R-point and can't find it anywhere. Watched 'Tunnel' and the 'Taxi driver' today. Excellent movies.ï»¿
"james coburn well. I found two full movie of R-point on youtube. One is non-free and another one has only portuguese sub.Here is a trailer with english sub.https://youtu.be/9w1f0noK18sI am a horror fan. R-point is one of the amazing horror for sure.Which really scared me are Texas chainsaw massacre original. R-point. Chaser. Wailing. I saw the devil.Not watched Tunnel yet and taxi driver is really good film based on a true story yeah.ï»¿"
Thank you.ï»¿
just a question tho... why was the cutscene not included in the movie? that would've made things clearerï»¿
Kimeongeee Wu which cut scene?ï»¿
Muradoin watch memories of Murder if you have not done so already!ï»¿
BLACKOUT Thanks for sharing.... Really enjoyed this movie.!ï»¿
"BLACKOUT thank you for clarifying bc I was confused about what was going on with this movie. I really enjoyed it and will probably watch it again, but now when I do I'll actually understand what's really going on. For me that makes all the better. Oh, and if anyone can tell me if the guy in Rigormortis was dreaming or dead that'd be super! Again, thanks for breaking this down!ï»¿"
BLACKOUT    you are AWESOME.. thank you for passing on information direct from Korea !!   THANKYOU FROM SAN FRANCISCO CALIFORNIA USAï»¿
Why did the devil do a ritual on that dead guy? To invoke God to transform that guy into a zombie?ï»¿
"I didn't knew about the ""Tochack-ryung"", good to know, and I think that the director made the right decision. Those little scenes would make the movie too obvious, though that confusion about the rituals was a little bit unnecessary.ï»¿"
"That explains a lot, especially now that I know about the ghost protecting the village. Had I known about that myth from the start, the ending might've been obvious. But.. it seems like such a bad reason for her to wear the clothes. If there's no tradition where the ghost's required to wear the clothes of someone she wants to protect, then the director can't assume that I should know this. It was just used as a tool to make the father not trust in her. It's so weird that she has to wear those clothes that it doesn't make sense.ï»¿"
For what I understood it's the clothes of the ones she FAILED to protect. It's a bit too much to ask us and the father to know this difference.ï»¿
"Either way, it felt more like it was only made to create confusion and doesn't feel realistic. Amazing movie, still.ï»¿"
"Hey BLACKOUT one thing I wanna know though: I know it's been 2 years since this movie but: who are the two old photograph in the Japanese ceremonial room? There's two black and white picture if an old man and an old woman, who are they?ï»¿"
Thank you!!!!! I just watched the movie and I got confused with the ending. But now I can find the missing link.ï»¿
"wow,, Thank you BLACKOUT in your area!It took me two years before watching these clips you provided.but I agree that the ending was just rightï»¿"
DrugStar1136 I guess that was ancestor of Japanese man bc my grandfather(born in 1926) also did same thing like he always hang up two pictures(his grandfather and grandmother) in his room and it was quite common in traditional Korean and Japanese culture.ï»¿
So young man who studied theology die or alive?ï»¿

"@Muradin 83 man I recommend New World (Shinsegi) 2013 film. One of the best Korean film's I've ever watched. If you liked I saw the devil, I'm sure you'd enjoy this film too.ï»¿"
"Blackout, thank you so much for this. Your explanation helped so much,ï»¿"
"Yes, I always knew the girl is the village protector spirit. When she failed to stop the guy from running to his house, her screaming (wailing) sounds like she's so devastated that she failed to protect them.ï»¿"
I just saw the wailing but I canâ€™t watch the uncut scenes and  thereâ€™s no subtitle for the interview of the director. I like this movie sooo much and thank you for your explainationï»¿
Your english is good manï»¿
"Its clear that the girl was hurting where the shaman drove the nails, but we can equally well say that it is the daemon that is hurting (which is inside the girl) so this proves really nothing. Also the ""angel"" lady said that the daughter is hurting because of the sin of the father, that the father killed a man, but it happened after she was possessed so this cannot be a reason. Also the guy that he killed turned out to the devil, so how come can it count as a sin. There is a scene where they throw the Japanese man out of the road and then both the angel lady and the shaman seem to be quite content and the shaman even says something like 'they got the rat' or 'the rat has fallen' (don't want to put emphasis on 'them', but rather on the 'rat'). Something doesn't stick together. The director said supposedly that the angel lady is a good entity in this movie so that is something we can rely on, but the rest of the scenes don't add up to this. I wonder if the director wasn't as confused as we are now.ï»¿"
"He actually says ""the rat has fallen into the trap"" which I think means that the shaman WANTED jong-gu to kill him. Think back to what the guy says in this video where the victims are those who lost faith and sinned. Maybe that's what he meant?ï»¿"
"The good spirit can't protect  jong-gu no longer after he sinned. The only way to protect him is if  jong-gu shows her faith, but he runs away to his house. You see that flower wither when he enters his home. He ran into his demise.ï»¿"
"Timmy Turner But even if he didnâ€™t go in the house, his daughter already did the killing before he entered and spoiled the trap. I still donâ€™t see how his family would have been saved if he stayed away like the lady in white told him toï»¿"
I think the lady in white knew that there is nothing she could do to save the father's family so she was just trying to at least save the him and prevent him from tripping the trap.ï»¿
"I think the Demon is using the Shaman against his will, if he doesn't then he'll eat his soul. or the Demon owns the Shaman's tainted soul so the Shaman has to do its bidding. Gotta understand the ""Oni"" Japanese Demons side to understand what the Demon is doing. The shaman is greedy for money. If the Demon really did die, then the Shaman would be free of it. But since the Demon knew that the Shaman was rejoicing, it got mad and said ""I'm alive but this dead japanese guys soul is now in hell so I'm taking this human's body.""ï»¿"
"Also would like to point out that both the japanese man and the shaman was taking pictures of the priest and jong-goo at the end. Basicly laying claim to their soul because evil have won, think fatal frame if anybody have played it before. Japanese do have a culture of believing that a picture can capture the soul.ï»¿"
"Ryan Yg its not only japanese, in my culture, its almost the same, except u must not take pictures of someone sleeping. Other cultures believe in similar ways with pictures as well.ï»¿"
"Good explanation, just one giant hole - you don't mention that while the shaman is performing the ritual, the Japanese man is also suffering - obviously from the ritual. And the shaman almost kills him but is interupted by the policeman - which causes the Jap to later come to his sesnses.ï»¿"
"It's not obviously from the shaman's ritual. He is resurrecting the man in the car as a zombie, using his own life force is what I made of it. The two rituals have nothing to do with each other, the fact that they're shown side by side is one of the many misdirections in the movie.ï»¿"
"Hmm, pretty convenient timing. And what is the shaman's ritual goal then? Is he doing it just for the show? It seems to be succcessful until the shaman gets interupted and then conveniently the jap comes back to life. Too many coincidences makes me think that those 2 are conncected but of course everybody can have an opinion.ï»¿"
"I know I'm about 6 months late, but this is for anyone else reading. He is resurrecting a zombie (not at the same time as that other prick performing the ritual), in order to kill the policeman, as we can see that the zombie did actually attack the father later.ï»¿"
"Radioactive FistFoot I'm late too. What I got from it was that the girl in the white dress (angel) somehow may have attacked the Japanese man (devil) during his ritual, through some sort of spell, or ritual of her own . This is because if you notice 1. He has pain all over his body, whereas only the policeman daughters eyes are in pain, and 2. he sees her afterwards. However, it seems unsuccessful as the zombie ritual still works. Great film nonetheless!ï»¿"
Great video man. 10/10ï»¿
Theres no evil its just mushroom effects _Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
a sad but super good movieï»¿
I thought similar to you - My take was that the woman in white was the ''good'' in the film and that the Japanese man and the Shaman were the ''evil'' in the film. I didn't think the shaman was evil until he met the woman in white. When he took the photo at the end that confirmed for me he was in partnership with the Japanese man.ï»¿
Nice job. Makes it twice as impactful when u have a full understanding of everything. Thank you.ï»¿
"Both ritual's were interrupted, not just the one on hyo jin. While the monk was hammering in the stakes for the ritual being performed on hyo jin(you see her holding her eyes in pain while the monk is hammering in the eyes on the item) the japanese man falls over in pain and doesn't complete the ritual, however he is not in pain from his eyes but from his body, what do you make of that?ï»¿"
Big Sauce yeah this Is a big detail.. itâ€™s possible that something went wrong with what the Japanese man was trying to do with the guy he raised from the dead. He did seem surprised when he got to the truck and the guy was gone.. maybe surprised that it worked despite him not completing it? Idk.ï»¿
MetalliBucket I think maybe it was the girl in the white dress who stopped the Japanese man's ritual? I mean he sees her afterwards right?ï»¿
"director said in interview the scenes were cut together like that to reflect their similar rituals (mumbling about and killing chickens) but did NOT play out at the same time!meaning monks ritual didnt affect devil AT ALL. devils pain comes from white lady approaching because she is a strong spirit protecting the village. both monk and even devil get fucked by her presense alone.she couldnt directly help anyone after they have sinned and or lost faith. even gods got rules i guessï»¿"
"man what a film. Still shook by it, I'm keeping my eye on south korea, first it was train to busan and now the wailing. I got the host on my list as well. we'll see how it goesï»¿"
PapiDarko see memories of murder. Probably the best Korean movie a long with old boyï»¿
"memories of murder is the best korean film ever made, and one of the best films of all time in generalï»¿"
PapiDarko Try I Saw the Devil and The Chaser. The latter has the same director as The Wailing.ï»¿
"The host, I saw the devil, old boy, lady vengeance.. So many good moviesï»¿"
"Thanks to everyone for the recommendations, I'm gonna check them all out. keep em coming already saw The Host i liked it but not as much as Train to Busan and The Wailing.ï»¿"
PapiDarko nothing beats memories of murder... greatest shit i ever sawï»¿
"Lol, you're hella behind if that's all you've seen so far.Memories of MurderMotherMan from NowhereOld BoyNew WorldChaserI Saw the Devilï»¿"
"Came to this video after watching the wailing to see other peoples thoughts on the ending. Am happy to see all these movie suggestions, i didn't see anyone mention a tale of two sisters yet, fkn amazing, if you enjoyed the wailing I'm sure you'll love it.ï»¿"
"I don't understand why people have MOM as a top film? Its good but nowhere near TOP 10. I saw the devil, The Chaser, Old Boy, Man from Nowhere, The Wailing, New World, Nameless Gangster are far better than MOM. MOM is too slow paced and reminds me a lot of Zodiac(far better than Zodiac, but is very similar).ï»¿"
"Out of all those films you named mother has the most relatable theme. Simply put, it's about a mother's love for her son and everything she'll do for him. And then the acting is awesome and the story well put.ï»¿"
Thean from nowhere is fantastic and I belive you can catch it on Netflixï»¿
Check out this directors previous films as well. So so good.ï»¿
"""man what a film. Still shook by it, I'm keeping my eye on south korea, first it was train to busan and now the wailing. I got the host on my list as well. we'll see how it goes"" - says a korean lolï»¿"
"You should watch, Oldboy...that movie shocked me and also kind of made me addicted to korean films, I woudn't be lying if I said it is the best movie I've seen. Brilliant plot twists, cinrmathograpy, music, acting, everything. I would say that Kim ki duk, Park chan wook, Bong Jong Ho and Kim ji woon are some of the best korean film makers.I want to recommend some more things too. There are other genres of korean movies that you may like, like My sassy girl or Save the green planet. And they are not korean but you should check Takashi miike and Sion sono, they came up with Suicide club, Tag, Box, The happiness of the Katakuris, Audition, and several more.ï»¿"
Boy... u lateï»¿
Try a korean film i saw the devilï»¿
Watch the fluï»¿
Train to Busan was trash tbhï»¿
"Blind, Psychometry, Sympathy with Lady Vengence, My Wife is a Gangster, Man from nowhere, My Sassy Girl,ï»¿"
One of the most underrated Korean horror films is R Point. Probably in my top 3.ï»¿
"all the movies I would have suggested were already mentioned so Ill add a fun comedy action ""arahan""ï»¿"
Omg Train to Busan was one of the best movies ive ever seen. Best zombie flick by farï»¿
"I agree with you Overexposed,  great video :)ï»¿"
"It makes sense, but it doesn't mention that perhaps everything was triggered by the relationship the police has with her daughter. There's something there.ï»¿"
WTF??ï»¿
Lol what !? How did you come to that conclusionï»¿
