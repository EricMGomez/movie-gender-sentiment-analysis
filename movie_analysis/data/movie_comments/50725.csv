Best movie ever made.ï»¿
Underappreciated film for sure.ï»¿
Amazing movieï»¿
How has this become relatable to me now?ï»¿
Why is it every time they make a comedy they put a fat guy in it and try to make him up sound and look like Chris Farleyï»¿
"WATS THE NAME OF THE SONG THAT BEGINS  with""1..2..3 plz help meï»¿"
One of the best movie I've ever watchedï»¿
That 80â€™s showï»¿
How many movies have Anna Farris and Chris Pratt been I. Together _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
Plot Twist: They never play the track Take Me Home Tonight.ï»¿
I seriously got Anna Faris confused with Emma stone.ï»¿
Most underrated movie everï»¿
Hï»¿
Remember watching this when it first came out and got excited but was too predictable story. It was slow and than it got fast towards the middle. Thought Anna and Chris would last forever.ï»¿
Kristen Stewarts twin lol so weird.ï»¿
Da li se taj film kad je na televiziji da li tori snimaju do grudiju ili do pupkaï»¿
Love this movieï»¿
That Straight Outta Compton part is what made me wanna watch the movie cuz I was a huge NWA fan. Also a huge 70s Show fan lmaoï»¿
thats the super toopers dude right? schnazz berries dude?ï»¿
Sounds like it has an awesome soundtrack!ï»¿
Superbad 2.0ï»¿
I actually thought this movie was underratedï»¿
Letâ€™s show the entire plot line of the movie in the trailer! Yay!ï»¿
2017.... anyone??ï»¿
Does Eddie Money make a cameo?ï»¿
This should have been waaay more successful.  The film is fantastic!ï»¿
I just found this movie DVD at the 1 dollar store XD! It was worth it thoï»¿
One of the funniest filmsï»¿
"Very funny movie, don't know why it gets so much hate. :/ï»¿"
"I feel like with a couple changes, this could have been a masterpieceï»¿"
topher grace and teresa palmera are supposed to be like the same age?ï»¿
"in fairness it was filmed 10 years ago, slightly more believableï»¿"
the real that 80s showï»¿
Another movie to remind us how dumb the 80's were.ï»¿
CrazyMunky84 I bet you are a 10 year old! And in the 80s u were not even born you were just inside your dad's nutsack ! Dumb idiotï»¿
Born in 82. Saddest part of my life is that I had to spend 7 years and 8 months of life in that stupid decade.ï»¿
I looked at comments to see trolling and that's it give a like if you agreeï»¿
Watching this in 2017 and wondering when it's going to come out... just about 6.5 years late to the party lolï»¿
"HELL YEAH, ANNA FARTS!ï»¿"
This was a good film...ï»¿
I could imagine this was Chris Pratt's actual proposal to Anna Ferris _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
saved 1 hour and 30 minutesï»¿
great song good movieï»¿
Pretty big shoes to fill when Kyle Reese is your fatherï»¿
Michel Biehn was a heartthrob in the 80's. Here he is playing a dad in the 80's.ï»¿
"Just seeing this for the first time, anyone think that Topher Grace and that big guy from Fantastic Beasts are dorky version Leo and Jonah from WoWSï»¿"
alexxxandder yessss I DID.ï»¿
"""What you're gonna do is what you're gonna be, and I just don't know what I wanna be yet"". No truer words have ever been spokenï»¿"
I am sooo glad I haven't seen the trailer before I watched the movie. The scene where the police man is his dad was the biggest and funniest surpise to me. Why the hell did they put it into the trailer???ï»¿
Where was I in 2010?!ï»¿
THIS REMINDED ME SO MUCH OF ERIC FORMAN_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
Rap music ruined this movie!ï»¿
"I was watching this movie thinking ''Wow, the Twilight girl must have taken acting lessons""ï»¿"
Why not JPM? Why Goldman?ï»¿
Funny thing is Chris Pratt is married to Anna Faris in real life.ï»¿
"Yeah...., not any moreï»¿"
i honestly didn't realise this wasn't kristen stewart until the credits rolled..ï»¿
Ginnifer Goodwinï»¿
This seems to be Topher Grace's style.ï»¿
foreal lmao 70s n 80s shitï»¿
Great movie. Great music.ï»¿
I know it was Teresa Palmer because Kristen Stewart can't smile!ï»¿
"2009 called, it wants its joke back!ï»¿"
They missed a trick. They should have called it that 80s movieï»¿
mark talbot more like they missed a CHEAP TRICK!!!ï»¿
I guess Michael Cera and Jonah Hill were busy..ï»¿
Craig you forgot Kristen stewartï»¿
Craig _Ÿ˜‚ lmaoï»¿
Lmao trueï»¿
I think Jonah Hill was losing weight around the time this was out and busy being in the COD MW3 trailer.ï»¿
that's Chris prattï»¿
I can't believe this came out five years ago.ï»¿
HindsightPOV time flies so fastï»¿
I knew I saw here the moment I saw the movie Lights out good movie btw plus she looks so beautiful on this movie best movie ever â™¡ï»¿

"Nope, total bummer.ï»¿"

Everybody Wants Some is a much better replacement for the 80's over this movie.ï»¿
"""remember the daze"" was a being in the 90s film just wasnt that good lolï»¿"

How have i not heard of this before now!!!!!!ï»¿
I guess nobody else wanted to mention how these actors are like 35 year olds playing teenagersï»¿
@daniel mendezÂ no they are playing people in their mid 20sï»¿
daniel mendez that's EXACTLY how films were in the 80s! Duh! _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
The Punisher umm Hollywood does this all the time. Not just in the 80s.ï»¿
daniel mendez they are actually in their late 20s.ï»¿
That awkward moment when Starlord was Venom's brother-in-law. ï»¿
Such an underrated film.ï»¿
tell me about it!ï»¿
For Real!ï»¿
Yeah it was very well made and a lot of fun imo.ï»¿
Such a good watch and really enjoyable. Really addictive to watch with an amazing cast and set in the 80's which has a great soundtrack. Who doesn't love this film. Shame its so underrated.ï»¿
"DreamCatcherX me personally I love the film so I don't care if other people haven't seen it but it does deserve more credit. I'm so glad Ive seen it because it really is the perfect film for me and really fun I have tried to spread it to my friends and told them about it. It was on Amazon prime but I think the reason it bombed was poor advertising, I never heard of this film before and I saw it on Amazon prime one day and checked it out but the poster for it is really shit, the poster turns you away as it makes the film look like a low budget film. Seeing the thumbnail on Amazon nearly turned me away but I read the description and watched the opening when he's in the music store with the Appetite for destruction logo in the background and was immediately hookedï»¿"
Love this movieï»¿
"Very.True story: I live in Phoenix.

"eh its ok. not saying the movie sucked or was horrible, i just don't think it had the right ingredients to formula what 80s time period really was.Not very 80s, felt like they were trying to incorporate 80s music to make the scene feel like it was the 80s. Unfortunate epic fail. It's hard to actually recreate a different time period into society with movies today. The last movies i saw that actually had a great retro time period into movies was remember the titans and starsky and hutch remake ï»¿"

Wonderful video. I'm here since my best friend all of a sudden started to be remarkable with girls. He went from zero to hero. He acted like it was normal for a little bit.

"@RobTheBernardinosaur Firstly, don't talk to me about trolling, since you're the one who initially insulted my comment. I was merely defending my point, and I was very careful not to insult the movie; I just wanted to shed light on the fact that the two movies are very similar. I didn't say anything that suggested I expected ""the most unique spectacular art ever made,"" I don't know where you got that from. Also, there's a difference between exactly what happens in the trailer and the actual plotï»¿"
@JohnRJMaxwell Lol troll more. Are you saying you wanted this movie to be the most unique spectacular art ever made? Movies are always similiar to each other they've making them since the 20s my friend. The movie is about a guy who works at a movie store and a girl he knew in highschool meets him up he lies about his job sees her at a party lies some more then gets into shit later on. It's not rocket science you're taking the movie out of proportion just let it be and stop crying about it. ï»¿
That girl is what would happen if Kristen Stweart and Scarlette Johanssen had a babyï»¿
it looks like Kristen Stewart and Scarlett Johanssen had a baby...ï»¿
haha cuteï»¿
"@RobTheBernardinosaur No, it's clearly not. Don't take me for an idiot when you don't know who your talking to; I was saying that the plot is pretty much the exact same. In both movies, a socially awkward graduate doesn't know what he wants to do with his life, and ends up working at a really crappy job, but to his surprise it ends up being a really awesome summer where he awkwardly woos the girl of his dreams and learns to let loose. THINK before you spit out stupid comments like that, savvy?ï»¿"

"@gruduvu never bragged about it and even if I never make the first move who's to say that I don't like playing the game and having them come to me and do all the work because to be honest thats alot of work to pursue and I'm lazy so I just have them come to me, It's alot easier. Kick back relax and dont act like a douche and they'll come to you naturally unless you're ugly in that case you have to put in the work.ï»¿"
@gruduvu funny thing is I'm high while typing this haha I'm far from angry. thats not very nice to call me a bitch since I'm probably the only one that feels pity for you. I never bragged that I get kissed by girls first I just dont like the fact that just because a girl makes the first move you call them a slut which is wrong of you. so stop getting your panties up in a bunch and take my offer of helping you out with girl problems or atleast accept my pity upon you.ï»¿
"@chamboy15 Theres no need for insults, i didnt insult you. Anyway, why are you attacking me? We agree on most thing. Maybe its true that im lonely but only beacuse mostly ive been with sluts more than normal girls and a normal girl would never kiss a guy first, at least where I live but that doesnt I mean i dont approve it. One more thing! If im lonely, youre angree. SMOKE SOME WEED, MAN BITCH!ï»¿"
You can't name a movie the title of a popular Eddie Money song and not have it in the movie right? lolï»¿
@Hootshot112 omg I just did the same thing.... freaky.ï»¿
"I couldn't sleep, it's 2 AM, so I watched some movie trailers for about 30 minutes. Now I just watch this one, and suddenly I'm perfectly sleepy. Good night everybody. ï»¿"

thanks for showing me the whole funkin movie!!ï»¿
"looks like a shitty unauthentic movie, typical plot line!ï»¿"
The only part I like is the song!ï»¿

Isn't she the girl from scary movie?ï»¿
looks like one of the old awesome movies. can't wait!ï»¿
"anna faris really looked like bree olson, if you know what i mean :Dï»¿"
Instant classic.ï»¿
@MagicApplesBubz Because no one would see a movie with two fat guys unless it was a Fat Boys movie. Plus over weight people need to work too. I guess it's the same way with other movie formulas like the white guy and black guy buddy movies or the one girl who isn't all that pretty until she changes her hair or something else stupid. How many movies do you see where 2 black guys are main characters and it's not some comedy or something gangsta related.ï»¿
Skiny guy fat guy...this is getting old...ï»¿
I love movies like this =))) Looking forward to it!ï»¿
So this is what happened to Ferris Bueller after high school..ï»¿
why is it always the normal boring guy and the risky trouble prone fat friendï»¿
"All the elements of suck are here. The annoying fat guy, the broke lying loser, the zany suitations, cant hollywood think of something else? Still digging in that same well I see....ï»¿"

Can't hardly wait :) hahaï»¿
Â¡Â¡Â¡IS VENOM!!!ï»¿
"lmao! only good part is the last part, the rest is shit....oh ya and the hooking up in the bathroon and then gets the shit knocked out of himï»¿"
one of those trailers that basically shows the whole movie. coool trailer tho. wasnt expecting that.ï»¿
a must see! great movie!ï»¿
Kris can't be Blonde.. she looks so weird with that blonde hair..ï»¿
Hey Eric Forman's back! LOLï»¿
MMEEEHï»¿
"@gruduvu  from the various comments saying that it happens all the time here proves that you're a lonely person. If a guy doesnt kiss a girl on the first date, its understandable if he wants to respect her boundaries; he's only a pussy if he's too scared to. If you were around girls enough you would see that alot girls these days are taking the initiative and making the first move more because they're tired of waiting on guys to do it because we're a bit lazy and put in enough effort.ï»¿"
"@blackbruelee I know, Michael Biehn is awesome!ï»¿"
Eric Forman's dad is really Kyle Reese. Thumbs up!ï»¿
@OsdarShady22 yep. he isï»¿
"@Juggernaughty824 haha yeah, it does look totally shit tbhï»¿"

@gruduvu idk but itd be coolï»¿
@gruduvu It happened to me. ï»¿
"@DannyLeeBreen Usually when the board of directors thought that this movie is gonna suck when it wasn't even shown in cinema yet, that's what happen...ï»¿"

really hate when trailers show the whole fucking plot.ï»¿
oh my fuckin crap that girl that i think his sister is from SCARY MOVIEW WOOTï»¿

are we in 1970 again ? or is it just me ?ï»¿
Lame! I wish John Hughes was still alive.ï»¿
"@gruduvu it happened to me once. lol, American movies shoot for unrealistic things that you wouldn't see in real life. That's what makes them so exciting. Or stupid, depending on your taste. ï»¿"
its venom for spiderman! this mvie rocksï»¿
I LOVE THE STRAIGHT OUT OF COMPTON PART! Watched it like 15 times now. lolï»¿
I SAW DEMMITRI MARTIN IN IT!!!!! :O1:11ï»¿

"@4lex0akes yes you are right. she is not the actress from that vampire thing. I've just checked it on the net. thanks :) ï»¿"
"@crazyfudgey yup that's eric!ï»¿"
"@LadyDinz23 That's not Kristen Stewart, it's an Australian actress called Teresa Palmer.ï»¿"
@crazyfudgey Yeah it is.ï»¿
hahah wow wrong againï»¿
PEOPLE! THAT IS NOT KRISTEN STEWART. IT IS TERESA PALMER. ï»¿
"@coralmeredith Yes, im a guy and yes, most of us are pussies big time. If I take a girl on a date, im gonna be the one to show initiative, to show that she likes me, thats all. If a guy doesnt have the courage to kiss a girl, then hes a pussy.ï»¿"
"@chamboy15 Look, man! Diffrent countries, diffrent mentalities. Im from croatia and in here a girl would never kiss a guy first (were talking about normal girls, not sluts). If a guy doesnt have the guts to kiss a girl, hes a pussy. The initiative is always on our side! ï»¿"
@philipp357 You mean Eric Forman from That 70's Showï»¿
Stewart looks really strange as a blondï»¿
@WinterUltimate No it isn't. She was in The Sorcerers Apprentace.ï»¿
"the blond girl, I think she's the one who plays in that stupid thing with vampires ï»¿"
Man this movie looks awesome. It's like me sadly I can't decide wtf i wanna do Cars? Computers? Arghhh! ï»¿
LUCIFER RISING!!!ï»¿

"wheres donna, and steven, and kelso, and fez, and jackie?ï»¿"
"@philipp357 He's was not a doctor, he was psychopath that backstabed the whole team.ï»¿"
is that kristen stewart????ï»¿
@gruduvu  aww ur a guy arent u^^ well in my neck of the woods it happens all the time cuz around here there are these odd human beings walking around with something similar to penises who i think call themselves men.... but they're just pussies.ï»¿
@medinaboyz101 omg yeah i almost thought it was her and then i was like wait no...ï»¿
it look unpredictable ... i like it ï»¿
and thats the chick from the sorcerers aprentice! i love her!ï»¿
"Lmao! prob wont see it in theaters though,...ï»¿"
This movie looks great plus thats not Kirsten if you call yourselves real fans of her and say this is Kirstebn then Im sorry but this is Teresa Palmer she even has a diffrent voice not that husky stutering awkward voice and Kirsten could never pull off blonde this is girl is actually blonde. Shes way hotter a better actress and if Kirsten was in this movie I wouldnt watch it and I don't think I'd be only one that awkward chick can't act ï»¿
@XSpoOksUrLadyX How does Kirsten Stewart look like Teresa theres a real easy way to tell the diffrence Teresas Hot. Shes everything Kirsten is not shes not an awkward actor either Kirsten is always uncomrfirtable in her roles and if Twilight should be brought up after this comment Im just saying shes the worst Bella ever anybody couldve pulled it off better I don't know how that chick got into acting but shes got no talent. teresas way better and kirsten has nothing on her. ï»¿
@gruduvu ummm....... all the time? no really this is kinda of odd question were you being sarcastic or for real? if you're being for real then yeah girls kiss guys all the time. I guess not for you.... *awkward silence*  you'll get there someday.ï»¿
What the fuck is wrong with american movies. Its always the girls that kiss boys. When the fuck does that happen in real life?ï»¿
take me home to the  paradise city were the grass is green and the girls gone prettyï»¿
i dont get why doesnt she know who he is but she does? i dont understand can someone explain please?ï»¿
... not sure wether to watch this or not...ï»¿
@ddluver12345 thats not kristen  thats Teresa Palmer two different actresses. ï»¿
looks so funny.ï»¿
This actually looks good. ï»¿
EDWARD BROCK?ï»¿
@XDlolzilla and that's why it should be freakin awesomeï»¿
