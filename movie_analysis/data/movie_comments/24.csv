"Sublime and magnificent combination of exploitation-grindhouse, spaghetti western and kurosawa's japanese flick!ï»¿"
Such a disappointing sequel to one of the best movies of all time...ï»¿
"It isnt a sequel, kill bill.vol 1 and 2 are one movieï»¿"
The trailer for Vol. 2 should've just been The Bride's opening monologue.ï»¿
hanah good actres.ï»¿
"thanks for spoiling the part about her daughter, mr. trailerï»¿"
Showing BB in the trailer? Bad move.ï»¿
This is the best trailer.ï»¿
Kill Bill (the collective movie) is still my favorite film of all time.ï»¿
Was this as good (or better) as Kill Bill Vol. 1? I remember scrolling through scenes of this film and it looked boring to me.ï»¿
Y is the trio song from the good the bad and the ugly playing at the beginningï»¿

"The Last great American movie. This was as good as it was ever gonna get. After 2004, Hollywood was done. Originality and creativity peaked with Kill Bill, and American audiences witnessed the death of cinema and it was never going to be the same again. The best filmmakers were all from the 90s.  And this was Tarantino's masterpiece.ï»¿"
Ew this movie is crap.ï»¿
sidhu704 why do you think that?ï»¿
Nick Whittle  well some people have lack of good taste in movies _Ÿ˜‘_Ÿ˜‘ï»¿

with some action in betweenï»¿
Music makes the differenceï»¿
I love both but my favorite Is kill Bill 2(the training AND the end)ï»¿
Woah what the hell was that scene where Bill threw a knife at someone? I don't remember seeing that in the movieï»¿
Probably a deleted scene.ï»¿
I tink this all About Ninjaï»¿
"Sucks she didn't get to kill Bud herself, but it's ironic that the Black Mamba killed him. Lol so in a way she kind of did, just not personallyï»¿"
"he sends her off to train and become a killer then forgets hell hath no fury like a woman scorned :)ï»¿"
Yeahï»¿
Her finding her daughter was like me watching your Webcam Thoughts!ï»¿
"Tarantino, stop spoiling your movies in the trailer!ï»¿"
This movie is definitely a must watch! Especially the actions. Man those shit got me hookedï»¿
Talk about major spoilers! Although admittedly it was revealed at the end of vol 1 that the bride's daughter was still alive.ï»¿
12 years of Kill Bill Volume 2! One of the greatest films ever!ï»¿
I love this trailer. This look like very good drama film. But why this spoils whole film?ï»¿
"Wow, these trailers spoil the movie a LOT.ï»¿"
"It's cause is the new trailer, It was realesed years after Kill Bill was already legendary.ï»¿"

"This trailer is pretty good, but it spoils most of the movie. That said, it's one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen, from the coffin escape scene to the Pai Mei training montage to the emotional final dialogue Beatrix and Bill share, it just adds up to one beautiful, near perfect film.ï»¿"
I love how QT and Robert Richardson used the same color palette in the Training scenes as in Lady Snowblood. also if you pay attention the movie is full of nods to alot of classic martial arts and chambara flicks.ï»¿
damn this is practically a summary of the movieï»¿
I'm so sad this trailer spoils the whole movieï»¿
It really did but the film was really good thoï»¿
Great film. Great performances.ï»¿
@0:50 what song is thatï»¿
Elle Hahahaaahaa this pure blond. ... was always jealous of her. ..A real psycho. ..and for your Information Elle. .... Pai Mei hates you too. .. _Ÿ˜_ _Ÿ˜€ _Ÿ˜Å. .. you never ever got her sword. .. _Ÿ˜_ï»¿
