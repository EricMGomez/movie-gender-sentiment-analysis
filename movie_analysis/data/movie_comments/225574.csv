Any movie with Liam Neeson is amazingï»¿
"I was watching this movie while sitting on my donkey, her name is duck.ï»¿"
best movieï»¿
If they ever do a remake of Airport 1970 Liam Neeson should be D.O Guerrero. He would be perfect.ï»¿
Julianne Moore looks sexy in those glasses.ï»¿
"An other White shit movie, why hollywood every time made a such disgusting movies, It s all about the american and the Free world natrional security,  they wanted to demonsrate that every single amercian life is unsafe ""Political theory  called the FEAR THEORY"" and why they do this ?!! they do It to justify their wars in middle East and Afghanistan  they wante to manipulate and control  the popular opinion. I m getting sick of your pullshitï»¿"
"(SPOILERS) (SPOILERS) Well, the Arab doctor in the movie was actually a good guy while the main villain of the movie was actually related to a 9/11 victim, and he even goes on to make a speech on how the war in Middle East didn't solve anything and just caused more deaths.ï»¿"

"just don't watch trailers overall, they spoil way to much.ï»¿"
+1ï»¿
thanks...Â  but i watched the first 10 second. and stopedï»¿
krijnyo can you explane the reason why the boy hijacked the plane because i couldnt follow. was it realy because of the bad safety i mean wtfï»¿
The guy's dad was killed on 9/11 so he became a terrorist himself to get revenge so he and the black guy framed Liam Neeson in order to get the money.ï»¿
"Obviously it's the ""Red-Eye"" lookin dude at 54 secsï»¿"
"I haven't watched the movie yet, but my guess is that the person hijacking the plane won't be Muslim.  He'll probably be associated with a conservative group.  It's a pretty solid guess for every episode of Criminal Minds or pretty much any movie or TV show unless it's based on an actual event.ï»¿"
does this whole movie take place on a plane???ï»¿
yesï»¿
This was such a great movie!ï»¿
This movie was EPICCCCCCCCCï»¿

better than taken 3ï»¿
"The movie was good until the cringe worthyÂ end. Liam Neeson was allowed to escape with $150,000,000. ""What money?""ï»¿"
+Prof. Pickles I think the implication was that they never sent the money in the first place.  That was an inside joke between Liam's character and his boss.ï»¿
"+Prof. Pickles Thanks. Thanks for the spoiler underneath the trailer, mate.ï»¿"
@Dominique This movie is 2 years old. Anybody who comes back to a trailer of a movie that has already came out has probably seen the movie. And what I said is just a side note to the movie. It's hardly related to the main plot.ï»¿
"@Prof. PicklesÂ Oh, is it 2 yrs old? Gosh, everyone must have seen it by now, right? Not. Why would I watch a trailer for a film I saw?ï»¿"
This movie is so underrated. Just finished watching it. IT WAS EPIC.ï»¿
+Rebecca Hope it's one of the best movies i've ever watched i do agree!ï»¿

My heart was exploding the whole movieï»¿
"I saw the movie a month ago on 4 and literally I thought it was boring, I'm sorry Liam Neeson is a legend and I was dying to watch this but it wasnot what I thought. I think the best line is ""I'm not hijacking this plane, I'm trying to save it"", best Neeson line and ONLY best line in movie. Im sorry I wish I loved it, but I didnae. Forgive me._Ÿ‘__Ÿ‘__Ÿ‘_ï»¿"

So Ra's al Gul trying to stop bad guys in a Taken plane.ï»¿
Shitï»¿
Would probably go through the movie to know how he got message when everyone's hand was up or were in seats! I'm just wondering how could a flight be if it got shot in the window when it's up high. But the twist was AWESOME thoï»¿
What about it though?ï»¿
"the first message in the trailer is different to the first message in the movieï»¿"
this is the Liam Neeson challenger: taken vs rage http://i298.photobucket.com/albums/mm244/luigimanultra7/nicolas-cage-hair-is-a-bird.jpgï»¿

"Good movie. I thought.. well, I don't wanna give his name away completely. But I thought L.R. was to be the killer and he wasn't. And then I thought perhaps Liam was insane and that wasn't the case. Or maybe it was. You'll have to see yourself.ï»¿"
i don't need to watch movie after watch this trailer what a jack ass!ï»¿
"Only the first minute of this trailer is necessary. Thats enough to captivate the audience, we get an understanding of what the plots going to be about and you bet we want to go watch the movie to see the outcome. The next minute and 22 seconds is literally just unnecessary spoilers.Â Anyhow, I watched this for the first time tonight, great movie!ï»¿"
What's the music at the beginning ?ï»¿

can someone give me a movie recommendation for a movie like this? I already watched flight plan btw and it doesnt have to be about planesï»¿
@LilJew96 Executive Decision... classic 90s action... also Air Force One with Harrison Ford... take that movie for what it's worth hahaï»¿
my favourite movie i have seen this hundreds of timeï»¿
had my heart in my throat during the whole movie..and now im scared of airplanesï»¿
"Yep, thats the same feeling i hadï»¿"
I want to be a pilot but Emmmmm... You know whatï»¿
Liam Nesson is just the perfect version of Badass !ï»¿
If this flight goes to London. Why does that nerd hijacker say at the beginning I'm flying to Amsterdam?ï»¿
Re-watch the movie... It's explained.ï»¿
I got fast and furious 7 and non stop and after earth and survivor I want to trade for the new Smosh movie ï»¿
Good movie elisa ï»¿
old school action movies.. epicï»¿
great i just saw the entire plot on the trailer so i dont have to watch it! thanksï»¿
"It is a good movie. I recommend it to those who gotta see another Taken feel movie. I didn't feel fully satisfied because I am unfairly thinking this is a ""Taken 2.5"" movie. I would not recommend paying 10 bucks for this movie on youtube. Watch it for free. Haha. I found the movie to be ok but I wish I have seen something better. ï»¿"
Makes me think of flight plan.ï»¿
"awesome movie... amazing intense moments, action, and everything,,,, just amazing,, highly recommended Â !! u will never regret it :)ï»¿"
