"I always watched this with my Dad as a kid in the early 90s. He loved it. Back in the days when the Discovery Channel showed it over 3 days as it was so long! Liked it back then, but can appreciate even more how brilliant it is now. Probably the most accurate depiction of German soldiers = humans rather than monsters. Just like us, they were simply fighting for their country.ï»¿"
Das Boot vs Saving Private Ryan. Which one is better?ï»¿
"das boot (director's cut), Ryan does some weird shit towards the end I don't like.ï»¿"

"0:55Gives me chills.ï»¿"
They should have used the original das boot theme.ï»¿
"Ah, the trailer that led me to Two Steps from Hell, one of my favorite musical discoveries.Â  The piece playing is called ""Protectors of the Earth.""ï»¿"
that would happen doubt it but I would go nuts if they did.ï»¿
Also I know these are not foreign films but it would be great to see unmodified versions of the original Star Wars Trilogy of the way they were seen back in there theater days before George Lucas changed them and include all the other versions as well too so you can see how the first three films in the trilogy were changed throughout the past three decades since they were released and tons of features when it comes to learning about the films now that would be a dream come true now if onlyï»¿
Whats the Name of the song thy use in the blu ray movie trailer?ï»¿
Justice Hutschenreuter darude - sandstormï»¿
with that then you'll love this company for sure you have a nice day bye.ï»¿
"I meant if you like foreign films you might be surprised how hard this film restoration company goes all the way by treating and showing respect to these important films give them a look and you might be surprised how hard they restore these films when it comes to picture quality, sound quality, subtitles and the history behind the films themselves but I'm just saying in my opinion you don't have to agree with me on that if you have different opinions when watching a film but if you do agreeï»¿"
"If the sound has been redone then no thank you I rather see Criterion restore this German classic the way it was meant to be seen and I mean all 293 min of it with English subtitles the way the Germans experienced it back in Germany with a well restored picture and tons features so I can learn more about the film it's self.In no way do I want to watch a film that has been modified for American audiences just proves that who ever restored this film doesn't seem to care at all if you don'tï»¿"
I haven't seen the blu-ray version yet but the DVD directors cut had all of the sound redone.ï»¿
magnificent to see such primitive submarines wreak such hell on the enemy.. the pro zionist allies.. ï»¿
Last but not least is the sound quality better in the uncut version or is it just how this film was made just wondering because I couldn't hear what the actors were saying in the Director's cut but thanks for the advice.ï»¿
a by gone era then look these silents up now I just need to see this modern day German masterpiece.ï»¿
"Thanks for letting me know which version to get and also I got some very rare films from Criterion from Hollywood's golden era.3 Silents From Josef Von Sternberg.Underworld: Country (United States) (1927) (81 min)The Last Command: Country (United States) (1928) (88 min)The Docks Of New York: Country (United States) (1928) (75 min)Also I discovered that The Last Command has one of the best actors in Hollywood's past history.Trust me if you want to see some of the best acting inï»¿"
"No. There are three versions - the pussy theatrical cut, the improved Director's Cut (which this trailer is promoting), and the 293-minute ""Original Uncut Version"". The last one is the one you want. Look it up on amazon.ï»¿"
was are you sinking about? xDï»¿
Got to be watched with subtitles and the original German soundtrack. Probably the greatest war movie ever made.ï»¿
I know it's classic but I want to see it the way the German audience saw it back in the 80's not when it's edited or Americanized.ï»¿
"Does this version have good sound quality all the original salty comments and all 293 min or not?Let me know.ï»¿"
Is this with bass effects ?ï»¿
Hab' ich schon weit vorher. ;)ï»¿

"@archangelsharky Two Steps from Hell - Protectors of the Earththat is the name and composerï»¿"
does anyone know the title of the song playing at 0:39 ï»¿
Great trailer for the re-release of Das Boot! I'm just finishing the DC Blu-Ray and it's awesome.ï»¿
@vaalraines018 aaww i searched for this video just to say what the song was. :'( u beat me to it. well played.ï»¿
"@lemonylime42 @friendo1231 the track is called ""Protectors of hte Earth"" by Two Steps from Hell, found on the Invincible soundtrack. Real good one :P ï»¿"
@lemonylime42 I was wondering the same thing.ï»¿
