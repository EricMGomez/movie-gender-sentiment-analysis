"This movie truly touched home for me and I'm sure many others as well. Its such a beautiful story, sad ending and yet Meryl Streep who played the Mother had a plan that after she was gone, she made sure her family came together emotionally and looked at life in a whole different way. One of my favorite movies. Allows you to appreciate what you have and  live your life regret free. Forgive yourself for mistakes and never judge. This movie truly .made me stop and think about everything I need to be grateful for, not what I am lackingï»¿"
