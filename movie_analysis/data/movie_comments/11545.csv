Beck + RUSHMORE: https://youtu.be/KtUH6q2QNXcï»¿
One of Wes Anderson's problems as a director is that he is constantly childish.ï»¿

ITS TIME HOMIE!! lmao _Ÿ˜„_Ÿ˜„ï»¿
"amazing film, not for everyone i guess, but it is very sweet and funny and witty, love it!  beautiful visuals combined with perfect soundtrack!ï»¿"
I'm on a bit of a binge finding quirky movies and this is on my radar now! Any more suggestions?! :Dï»¿
"Napoleon Dynamite, Garden State, U Turn, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou & The Grand Budapest Hotel or just anything from Wes Anderson,  Being John Malkovich. Enjoy!ï»¿"
"I would seek out Grand Budapest and BJM above the others on Omar's list (I just happen to think they're the best among those)... anyway, I'll add Brick, Election, Go, Groundhog Day, Fargo, Chungking Express, The Princess Bride, After Hours, and Heathers to the list.ï»¿"
"DrewKF, Bottle Rocket, The Fall, Gummoï»¿"

still fucking greatï»¿
Soundtrack was real damn specialï»¿

"Let's be honest, there's nothing not special about this movie- great show from start to finishï»¿"
"That may be your subjective experience, but it's really just your opinion. I think Rushmore is brilliant and will likely go down as a movie that was the first of its kind. An artistic display which shifted movie making's trajectory. Let's be honest, Rushmore is purely exceptional.ï»¿"
I'm going to stay neutral. :)ï»¿
"Misha _˜ÑÅ_°__Ñè The movie is special.ï»¿"
Does anyone know the name of the last song that plays in this trailer?ï»¿
it is someone's cover version of The Who's 'Quick one while he's away'ï»¿
"Ekaterina Alekseeva it's not a ""cover version"" it's a live version by The Whoï»¿"
@Barney Os. Thanks for letting me know. That's probably the first time ever I haven't recognised Roger's voice.ï»¿
"Ekaterina Alekseeva I believe the version used in the movie is stitched together between the 1966 album version and the live version they played in 1969 for The Rolling Stones' Rock N' Roll Circus. The Rolling Stones invited a bunch of bands to come together to film a TV concert movie, but they never released it, and a lot of people think they didn't release it because The Who totally blew everyone else off the stage.ï»¿"
Name of all songs please!ï»¿
I'll stick with Napoleon Dynamite.ï»¿
cinema sÃ©tima arte.ï»¿
"Great movie! Grab a babe, pop some popcorn, sit back and let Rushmore take you home baby!ï»¿"
Wes Anderson's movies are like.... the same movie.ï»¿
"Oh yeah, Grand Budapest Hotel, this and Fantastic Mr Fox are just OOZING with similarities.ï»¿"

Rushmore is a great film!ï»¿
Rushmore is a great film!ï»¿
"How fucked up do you have to be to think this is a good movie??? Christ, Bill Murray even sucked. A braless geeky hot teacher is the only thing going for this film.ï»¿"

"Jason Schwartzman was, and always will be, an adorable little person.ï»¿"
He's delightful indeed! https://youtu.be/KtUH6q2QNXcï»¿
"i watched this movie last night, though i have seen it before a long time ago, i watched it only for the acting ofÂ  Bill Murray because he is one of my favorite actors, then i realized while watching it that Max is a lot like me a guy ( or his case a teenager) who tries so hard to fit in and would go to extremes to try to do itï»¿"
The fact that this movie flopped at the boxoffice is a shame on mankind :/ï»¿
music is a big part of the success ...love itï»¿

"I loved the feel of this movie, quirky but very heartfelt. can anyone recommend any other films with this quirky feel, like Napleon Dynamite for example?ï»¿"
"Watch Wristcutters: A Love Story. Great movie, great soundtrack.ï»¿"
"Have you seen other Wes Anderson(Co writer & Director of Rushmore) movies ?The Royal Tenenbaums,The Darjeeling Limited,Fantastic Mr. Fox,Moonrise Kingdom,The Grand Budapest Hotel ??ï»¿"
"It's too easy to just name other Wes Anderson flicks, here are some that I've liked over the years, 'Me and You and Everyone We Know by Miranda July, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind by Michel Gondry, Amelie by Jean-Pierre Jeunetï»¿"
"well,i specified with the name of director because they are all of same kind and greatotherwise there are more than 100 whimsical and quirky movies out there .ï»¿"
Garden Stateï»¿
Submarine(2010)ï»¿
"moonrise kingdom, grand budapest hotelï»¿"
"anything by Wes Anderson has this feel to it, Hotel Chevalier is a great short film to watch, its under 15 minutes but its great.ï»¿"
Scott Pilgrim vs The world...awesome soundtrack. Away WeÂ Go.Â ï»¿
I enjoyed Charlie Bartlett. Sort of same feel... kind ofï»¿
"Other Wes Anderson movies are a good start. Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic, Darjeeling Limited, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Moonrise Kingdom, Grand Budapest Hotel. You can also see a lot of Hal Ashby in his movies especially Harold and Maude. Also Being There is a great one to check out.ï»¿"
I heart Huckabees was a great movie with lots of philosophical elementsï»¿
@Dylan doowï»¿

"Lol looks like the jews forgot to mention the most important philosopher whose principles in which the western world was founded (Jesus Christ), but lets not forget Gandhi!ï»¿"
I think they just wanted to avoid using fictional charactersï»¿
...ï»¿
So you're saying jesus christ is the foundation of Western Civilisation? You must of been indoctrinated very early on in life.ï»¿
"I watched this trailer on tv as a kid. I remember thinking ""I have no idea what I just saw, but I love it!"" When I saw the film 10 years later, I understood.ï»¿"
Fuck spoon read your comment in 10 years and see if you can understand then.ï»¿
No harm done. I'm sorry for being such a brute.ï»¿
"Beautiful movies! I loved it so much, watched over, over and over again..I just can say the film is the master of the artist, Excellence in combination of funny and classic.

"@allen sharako Clearly you lack a sense of humor, I'm just sorry you cannot distinguish between hyperbole and actual malice... loved the film and still love it. Now who is the rude shitface you punk salad tosser? Refrain from responding, nothing you can say will save you from the reality that is your bitter, pithy existenceï»¿"

Mr. Delaparra wooow did you met wes anderson?ï»¿
"Hey, awesome movie!! thanks for sharing the trailer footage, guys!! ;)ï»¿"
Wes Anderson is such a hipster douche as a filmmaker.Â ï»¿
Lol he was a hipster before it was cool. Perhaps the original hipster?ï»¿
All hipsters say they were hipster before hipstersï»¿
Hipster is just the newest term used by slobs like you to insult people who are cooler than they are. You just look patheticï»¿
"@SoftCoreSeziure Hipsters are not seen as cool by anyone other than hipsters.Â  They are seen as nerds that are trying to be more 'stylish' and 'cultured' than the previous generation of nerds.As for Anderson, i was into him back in the 90's when his style was fresh and interesting but it was played out a long time ago.He also can't really be a 'hipster' film maker because he is too mainstream.ï»¿"
@dios bananosÂ You can try to explain it all you want. At the end of the day you still just sound bitter and childish. You think that what you're saying is your own opinion but it's just something you heard and you decided to jump on the hate bandwagon. You're opinion is basically just like all the people who hate on Justin Bieber because it's popular to do. Learn to form your own opinions you hiveminded dolt. Maybe if you met more people you would learn that you cant reduce people to buzzwords.Â ï»¿
"@SoftCoreSeziureÂ Yes, were the one's coming across as being immature (sarcasm). At least we're not so immature as to insult the people were having an argument with and trying to belittle their arguments by accusing them of being immature and pathetic slobs.Â It's true I hate Wes Anderson as a writer/director, but I wouldn't call you a pathetic slob just because you posted something negative about a director that I happen to like.Â ï»¿"
"@SoftCoreSeziureÂ Was your original ""slob"" post directed towards me? Either way you're a jackass.ï»¿"
"LOL I remember when hipsters were called Indie (as in independent) and before that they were Punk or something... I like to think myself as indie but I don't care if you call me a fucking hipster, it amuses me xDï»¿"
@George B Japanophile.ï»¿
@George B Honestly your profile pict creeps me out and your lame quote by the Majesty the Queen makes me want to throw up...ï»¿
"@George B Nope dude, I'm a girl xDï»¿"

@kingshibbz The original hipster is Woody Allen.ï»¿
Sorry to resurrect the dead with this comment but your whole entire debate falls apart because your original comment was an insult towards someone.ï»¿
