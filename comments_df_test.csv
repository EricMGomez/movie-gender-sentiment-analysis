,Man. I remember back when I first saw this movie. I didnt know Jack about venom until about 2 or 3 years later. I was 8 when it came put. And I distinctively remember reading the movie book before seeing the movie. I finished it right before we parked at the theatreï»¿

11,"This movie followed the comic book, spider man fans can't really explain because this is how Peter would react so you can't really say it's bad and I'm a kind of person likes people who follow the source material.ï»¿"
12,May the 4th be with youï»¿
13,Seeing the trailer for the first time over a decade ago I was instantly hyped.... I thought it was going more of a serious route and be more grown up... Had to wait a year later for the dark knight to do that but whatever as a kid of course I loved it but over the years rewatching it got worse and worse. Not a terrible movie but a let downï»¿
14,What is happening can someone tell me if he dosent know he is evil like the goblin!! Is he evil!!???? Why is he being so mean did it turn him evil!!!!????? Tellll meeeeeee!!!!!!ï»¿

33,This and the rest of marvels garbage characters and writing from the beginning all the way to present day and I'm sure future is exactly why marvel will always cater to little snot nose fags.

73,"""this could be the end of spider-man"" ironically, it was lolI bet watching this trailer back then for the first time was mind blowing. seeing sandman as the first villain, and then seeing the black suit hinting at venom, and then Harry and green goblin!ï»¿"

78,Can't wait for this movie to come out!_Ÿ˜ƒï»¿
79,ppl can say what they want about this movie but it was a solid film. some parts could've been left out: him dancing and what not but and a little more Venom but overall a solid way to end the trilogy. I love Spiderman!!ï»¿
80,"nothing will replace this Spider-Man trilogy, homecoming stay away the amazingly shitty reboot naw, that music in the beginning of the trailer chills _Ÿ˜§ Spider-Man 4 is never to late #CARNAGEï»¿"
81,Why does old trailers sounds like parodies xDï»¿
82,I honestly dont understand why this movie had so much hate I mean yeah the dancing is unnecessary by peter but its really an awesome movieï»¿
83,just finished watching this one along with the other 2. it honestly isn't a bad movie just very disappointing when held up against the previous installments. it has a solid opening and a great finale but the middle of it is really cluttered and cringe inducing and some characters are pretty underdeveloped.  overall tho not a bad movieï»¿
84,Wow the whole movies in the ducking trailer lmaoï»¿
85,2017 and still waiting Spiderman 4ï»¿

129,"I was 8 years old when Spider-Man 3 came out. One of the first movies I ever anticipated seeing. I grew up with Spider-Man, reading the comics, playing the video games, coloring in color books and of course, watching the movies. I'm going on 18 now and it's so nostalgic looking back. This movie gets a lot of shit, but I love it, maybe I'm just blinded by nostalgia, but never the less I think it's a great film. As dumb as it sounds, I would love to go back in time and see it for the first time in theaters again, one of the happiest moments of my life.ï»¿"

145,"I was really excited by this trailer and the movie did not disappoint me. Maybe others, but not me. I think they should've continued with the Sam Raimi series instead of going into the Garfield ones.ï»¿"
146,"Thank you, Sam. I feel the same way. It's a shame that Spider-Man 3 was the last.ï»¿"
147,Y'all all saying sandman used godzillas roar but this movie came out before it so godzilla actually used sandmans roarï»¿
148,cool trailer !!!ï»¿
149,At least it's better than Batman v Superman.ï»¿
150,1:31) why did they used Zilla's roar?ï»¿
151,If this trailer came out today thier would be Easter eggs all overï»¿
152,Even the trailer is kind of bland.ï»¿

160,Hector Rincon me :Dï»¿
161,2:05 to 2:20 so epicï»¿

164,Still one of the best trailers.ï»¿
165,Hey Is That Venom And Carnage Movie Cancelled Now? Because The Amazing Spider-Man Got Cancelledï»¿
166,I heard they were still going through with it  but its going to be its own movie with no mention of the MCUï»¿
167,@Diablo Pesina I see. Do You Think It's Gonna Be Rated R?ï»¿

169,@Diablo Pesina Pretty Much too bad its audience is limited but it can do the same thing as deadpoolï»¿

181,CODdude34 you wildï»¿
182,Rhandy Ramirez it was a very good movie but not better than the second one_Ÿ˜ç_Ÿ˜ç_Ÿ˜çï»¿
183,LOL spidey looks so much better in this than in civil warï»¿
184,That suit was horrible! And in a Spider-Man 3 art book they show concept art of the Symbiote suit from the comics but they didn't stick with it.ï»¿
185,"2:08 Shit, he called it.ï»¿"
186,Lolï»¿
187,i pissed my pants when venom pulled tobey upï»¿
188,This film could have been so much more.ï»¿
189,The last I had watched is good movie but forget the spiderman 1 2ï»¿
190,Spider Man's suit isn't supposed to be black. It should look just like the Venom suitï»¿
191,Harry should've been the only villain in the movie. Would've been cool to see him manipulate Peter and try to ruin his life. Meanwhile Eddie Brock's character could be introduced and Peter consumed with his anger towards all the pain Harry's causing him would seem attractive to the symbiote. The symbiote would take him over and he could ruin Brocks career like in the movie and it would make an epic final battle between black suited Peter and Harry. Peter thanks to the symbiote would beat Harry but in his rage would murder him. Not just kill. Murder. Realizing what he's done and all that the symbiote made him lose he could go to the church and take off the suit where Brock was below. Then the cliffhanger ending could've been Brock turning into venom. Then we could have spiderman 4 with venom.ï»¿
192,I swear Sam Raimi better be directing carnage or I'm gonna be pissed. Seriously if you've seen evil dead the guy knows his stuff.ï»¿
193,"Uhhh, Raimi isn't directing any Spider-Man films anymoreï»¿"
194,WHY!!!!!!!!!ï»¿
195,sony didnt want him anymoreï»¿
196,1:31....um so why is Sandman screaming like Godzilla? Please tell me Im not the only one who heard thatï»¿
197,sandman sounds like godzillaï»¿
198,It's Zilla's roarï»¿
199,1:31 IT'S GODZILLA COVERED IN SAND!ï»¿
200,When i was just a lil kidi saw this trailer AND from some reason i didnt even knew about THIS SCENE 1:41idk whywith the black suit sceneï»¿
201,This was simply cutï»¿
202,@Albert12324's Official page I did not realize this scene in this trailer and I know its a deleted sceneï»¿
203,"Even this Spider-Man movie wasn't that good, I take this over any Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man movies. Tobey Maguire you are the best Spider-Man in my opinion! Favorite Marvel hero is Spider-Man!ï»¿"
204,J Rod13 disagreeï»¿
205,"in the end this was Sony's Dark Knight trilogy, summed up its solid as fuck just like MCU has only one good trilogy the Cap trilogy other than that hit and misses.ï»¿"
206,meï»¿
207,Did any one notice from 1:30 to 1:33 that Sandman sounds like Godzilla ?ï»¿
208,the trailer was better than the movie lolï»¿
209,dammnnn this trailer looks bad ass!but this movie is one of the WORST superhero movie ever made right next to Superman Returnï»¿
210,"They had plans for Spider Man 4. It was going be Peter retiring from Spider Man after marrying MJ, and having to come back to face the two new villains who were going to be Carnage and Vulture. I really wish Sam Raimi would have finish the project. He had the script done, but Sony just didn't think it would work, and they ended it with this film, which was a good way to end it with a trilogy.ï»¿"
211,they ended the movie's because Spider-Man 3 was terrible and not as good as part 2ï»¿
212,+Doggy they were still going to make it regardless going it would with out but idk if they Just decided to not take the risk and start all over or if it was cause another reasonï»¿
213,+Doggy that hasn't stopped Marvel Studios tho...so much garbage yet they still make em...ï»¿
214,2016 and still waiting for Spider-Man 4 to come out!!!ï»¿
215,Same instead of shit amazing spiderman....ï»¿
216,spiderman homecomingï»¿
217,wrrdï»¿
218,@Shayne Maccarelli the amazing Spider-Man movie series are lame and boring... I like these better... Too bad they never made the 4th...ï»¿
219,+Stephen S I'm probably one of the few people who wouldn't want a 4th one even if the third movie was good cause they would have done rhino kraven or vulture and I'm not a big fan of those spider man villains also idk where they would take peters character on an emotional levelï»¿
220,+Phantom Blade According to Tobey the writers or whatever wanted his character to go back to high school and Tobey said he didn't want to do that. Kind of sucks but oh well.ï»¿
221,The reason that they didn't make it is because of the ratings. No one liked spiderman 3 because the story was all off. And so they cut the 4th spiderman and start over and created of what we have now; The amazing Spider Man 1 and 2.ï»¿
222,+Brian Compton but I been waiting to see sand man againï»¿
223,+Phantom Blade me too but apparently the public didn't want to see that kind of movie.ï»¿
224,"Sorry man. Amazing came out, and while I thought that was ok...I am bummed out that there never was a 4th one of these. I am one of those people who liked ALL of the spiderman movies just to keep in mind. But I'm so dissapointed at the cancellation of a 4th one. I mean I heard they were gonna use the lizard in the 4th one and that sounds awesome and all. But the thing I just thought of that would make me line up no matter how bad or good the movie is, is if Carnage was in it. think about it, in the comics Carnage was the result of a small piece of Venom. And in the third film a piece of the symbiote survived unless I'm mistaken. So maybe it escaped and found Kasady and made Carnage. I would love to see that. I mean come on, Carnage is the one villain i think you couldn't ruin with a silly tone, as Kasady is an insane homicidal maniac. So the silliness would actually fit him.ï»¿"
225,There no more spiderman only the amazing Spider-Man 1'2ï»¿
226,@kwebbelkop fan Actually there is a reboot coming with the civil war spiderman. At least I hope that's true.ï»¿
227,@MauricetheHedgehogits true they are filming now and casted zendaya as Mary Jane Watsonï»¿
228,"@J- Rich I don't know who that is but if she's better than the one in the original it's cool with me. And hey, maybe we will FINALLY get to the Carnage plotline in live action form. I know it will be at least in a fourth film, but I can wait. I've always wanted to see Carnage in live action, especially after how cool venom looked in Spider Man 3(for ten minutes).ï»¿"
229,@MauricetheHedgehogmaybe idk marvel usually only does trilogies so idk if we will get carnage and venom but who knowsï»¿
230,"@J- Rich I won't lose any sleep, but I bet every Spider Man fan would line up to see him. And who knows...Marvel getting pretty good. And I believe there was a Spider Man 4 I the works with Carnage and the Lizard. But I don't know what happened. Probably the poor performance of Spider Man 3, even if some people liked it...like me.ï»¿"
231,@MauricetheHedgehogfrom what i'm seeing im assuming there going with the villains that we haven't seen like vulture who will be in the first one im guessing will get kingpin or Kraven in the other moviesÂ  villains like these. we may get carnage but i feel like they'd have to do venom first and idk if they would want to go back to that story maybe maybe not we will seeï»¿
232,"@J- Rich Yeah I know Venom would have to come first. But hey, gives them a second chance of making a good Venom in a live action film. I think kingpin should be in Daredevil...wait a minute.ï»¿"
233,@MauricetheHedgehogtrue idk yea im not doubting they couldnt do it im just not sure if marvel would want to risk that storyarch failing again. Also yea Kingpin is better with Daredevil but eh him and spider man have had funny interactions and its always interesting and funny seeing spider-man as a kid fighting a giant man like kingpinï»¿
234,@J- Rich I know. maybe Kingpin could be the mastermind and starts making criminals like in that not so good cartoon in the late 90's.ï»¿
235,im thought spiderman diesï»¿
236,sameï»¿
237,you're retardedï»¿
238,"Dr. Moocah Latte the spider man homecoming isn't even cool... The amazing and homecoming are lame... Both need a machined to shoot and sling spider webs... The one with Tobey, he actually got spider powers...ï»¿"
239,"Pretty sure most versions of Spider Man need web shooters. And BTW, Tobey is cool cause he got powers? So you forgive how winy he is and how much cringe there is to be had about him in Spider Man 3.ï»¿"
240,Phantom Blade Do you even comics dude? In the comics he actually has web shooters raimi was lazy as hell to not include themï»¿
241,"That Mysterious Guy Not necessarily because it made sooooo much money sony was more than happy to do a 4, 5, hell they even had a 6 in mind. But our noble director Sam raimi was not ok. With being forced to do another film with villains he didn't feel comfortable with(Venom) they fought back and forth eventually raimi decided it was time to move on because he didn't want to make another movie fans wouldn't like. Btw he was a big spidey fan himself so that must've been a hard decision, Spider man 1 and 2 are still masterpieces.ï»¿"
242,What's the song 1:22ï»¿
243,When the trailer is actually better than the actual movieï»¿
244,Ikrï»¿
245,"haha, this trailer is even better than the Batman V Superman trailer. At least they didn't fuck up and show venom at the end.ï»¿"
246,Buzzsaw Louie they did show Venom in the last Spider-Man 3 trailer.ï»¿
247,Ooh they showed Doomsday in the trailer. Who cares. That's just more hypeï»¿
248,Wow I was gonna say that but I'm 8 months late :( the trailer is better tho but I do love spiderman 3ï»¿
249,"i dont know why people hate this movie, i love itï»¿"
250,Damn I feel old 9 nine years ago got damnï»¿
251,If you discount the emo bullshit that Raimi put in the film just for the sake of it being there this a pretty good movie overall. I watched it recently and I have to say it's much better than I remember it to be. A Spider-Man 4 would have been awesome.ï»¿
252,This literally gave away the ENTIRE filmï»¿
253,Tobey Maguire is the bestï»¿
254,"Good trailer, not so good movieï»¿"

264,"This trailer made this movie look awesome, and then we got a total shit bomb that summer.ï»¿"
265,What was so bad about itï»¿
266,"@bobby joe It was poorly written, there were too many subplots, Peter Parker acts like a douchebag through the whole movie even without the symbiote, every character is unlikable, and all of the dancing scenes.ï»¿"
267,"I agree, what exactly did the serum do to harry? It was supposed to make him superhuman and he got his ass kicked, Venom was too small and his scream sounded like his balls were being squeezedï»¿"
268,Why are people disappointed by this movie? Like what's so wrong about it?ï»¿
269,"+Omar Gamez A lot of people didn't like the ""Disco Parker"" because it was just so goofy and out there that it kind of derailed from the tone of the movie and also Venom was very weak (portrayal wise). Personally I feel it wasn't a terrible movie but it's definitely not a great one.ï»¿"
270,wow the Nostalgia with this! I remember watching this trailer hundreds of times before the movie came out! those were the days!ï»¿
271,RockinRolla102 yes they were! 2007! I was watching this everyday until it came out _Ÿ–_ï»¿

277,"You know, Spider-Man 3 was a good way to end the trilogy if you look at it. It wrapped up the plot points from the first film, the story of the Osborn family concluded, peter overcame the odds and was able to ride himself of the guilt of the past forever and try to mend his relationship with MJ. it was a bittersweet ending, but a hopeful one. What's a more Spider-Man ending than that?ï»¿"
278,+StanLee4Ever We could have seen Carnage. Remember the professor still has that sample of venom. It could of escaped and found its way to  Cletus Kasady.ï»¿

431,this trailer sums up entirely why I don't hate Spiderman 3 as much as everyone else.ï»¿
432,I hate how they switched Toby with Andrew instead of making spider-man 4ï»¿
433,"Hahaha news guy ""this could be the end of spiderman"" well you weren't wrong lawl ï»¿"
434,I had so much hipe for this movie! While it may be better than the forgotten 1970's Spider-Man show all episodes in a row it is still laughable comapred to the first of the Sam Raimi trilogy.ï»¿
435,What's with fucking emo Peter Parker?ï»¿
436,"See, this movie is a great example of taking to many creative liberties and shitting all over the comic.Â This was a god awful representation of venom. Like really, really, bad. The whole sandman story-line was utter crap, and the movie barely grazed the emotional strain encircling the whole Goblin plot.ï»¿"
437,O.oï»¿
438,This trailer is awesome ï»¿
439,before the bwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahs took overï»¿
440,From 31 seconds in. What is that awful voice over for the chief police dude. That's not the proper actor and it doesn't even sound like a professional. It's like someone has snuck it in hoping no one notices. ï»¿
441,"I like how people say how the Raimi Spiderman series sucks compared to the reboot TASM movies. I have a few questions for TASM and Andrew Garfield as Spiderman:If the TASM movies were better than Raimi's Spiderman movies then why did TASM 2 get the worst reviews out of all the 5 movies?If TASM was better then why was the series canned only after the second movie? (low blow but true)If Andrew Garfield was better then why did Sony fire him after making a poor comment on how TASM 2 was made, actors in the past have gotten away with much worse and still kept their jobs.ï»¿"
442,"So agreed! In fact, one good thing from TASM is Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy.ï»¿"
443,"@James Van Oss I love both versions equally and I hate all this fighting that is splitting fans apart. But here, I'll answer your shitty questions.TASM 2 got the worst reviews because Sony didn't know what the hell they were doing. They were planning a silly cinematic universe to compete with Marvel. Sony had good intentions with this film, it's just they didn't know what they were doing and they over-marketed this movie.TASM was canned after the second movie because, again, the people Sony are idiots. They had big plans for this movie (BIG plans). The only thing that could go wrong was if TASM2 performed poorly, and it did. They didn't know what to do and they were losing the game fast, so they allowed Marvel to borrowed the rights so that movie they could salvage their popular franchise.I really can't answer the last one, I have no idea why Sony would do such a thing. Andrew as Peter and Emma as Gwen were the best things these films had going.I'm not going to pretend TASM2 was great, because it did have huge problems. But unlike most 'fans' nowadays, I genuinely like both versions. My order from best to worst are: SM2, TASM, SM, TASM2, SM3.ï»¿"
444,"@jorgie Fucking thank you! It's so great to finally see someone say the first part! Plus the second part is completely true. If ASM2 didn't have the cinematic universe BS, the reviews probably would have been around 70% or 80% on rotten tomatoes.ï»¿"
445,@James Van Oss the reason why ppl love tasm was the lame chemistry between emma and andrew an off screen couple just like how they loved twiglight seriesï»¿
446,Sony didn't want to end the Franchise they had to. Andrew Garfield fired himself. He wanted Miles Morales and he thought Marc Webb removed to many scenes.ï»¿
447,Btw the reason the first ones had such good ratings is because there was nothing to compare it to. It was the first Spiderman in 30 something yearsï»¿
448,I'm glad it ended after the amazing spider man 2 Sony was trying to make stupid ass movies to keep the rightsï»¿
449,"Sony?, blame Sonyï»¿"
450,I won't argue that the Marc Webb Spidermans aren't as good as the Raimi but you should never use what critics say as validation of a point. 90% of critics don't know jackï»¿

463,Yeah well everybody will jump on the bandwagon I know this movie wasn't that bad it had a few bad things and wasn't a complete wreck like both amazing spider man moviesï»¿

It&#39;s much better if you developed the characters more and so on, so forth.ï»¿"
506,"I don't hate spiderman 3. But in my opinion, it is the worst spiderman film to date. TASM2 was a disappointment but there 3 things that didn't work for me in spiderman 3.Â 1. Emo Peter2. Them changing spidey's origin and making Marko the killer of Uncle Ben3. And Topher Grace as Venom. And how they treated venom in the whole movieÂ That's just my opinion. TASM2 had lots of problems but I still prefer it over SM3.ï»¿"
507,I remember being 7 years old when this movie came out and I remember seeing the trailer a few times in the cinema and a few ads on tv for it and I was really looking forward to seeing it. I remember I saw it in the cinema and I actually really liked it. I'm 15 now and just recently I realised this movie sucks. It could have showed a lot more scenes with him fighting venom new goblin and sandman instead of romance scenes and fucking emo peter parkerï»¿

530,Will u guys stop comparing all the spider-man movies plz? I love all 5 of them and I don't hate any of them. Toby Maguire got the building of the plot and character better and Andrew Garfield got Spider-Man and Peter personality better. Both trilogy are fantastic and well made. I just don't know why Spider-Man is the main superhero to be criticized and watched for every little detail to be correct. JUST ENJOY THE MOVIES BECAUSE YOU HATERS AND CRITICS COULDN'T DO BETTER. U JUST SIT THERE AND JUDGE.ï»¿

537,When you watched this I bet you were 5. So please.ï»¿
538,My god. There is so much hate for the amazing spider-man 2. The Amazing Spider Man 1 & 2 are supposed to be close to the comics. Yeah I'm a big fan of Tobey Maguire a Spiderman. One two and three were pretty good but the best one was probably 2. It was good if you're not looking at the comic. But if you're looking at the comic and are big fan of the comics like me. Then you rather go to the amazing spider-man movies. People are saying the Amazing Spiderman 2 sucks because Gwen Stacy died over there wasn't enough action etc. but it's supposed to be a prequel 2 the Sinister Six or the Amazing Spiderman 3 let's just agree that everyone has their own opinions. And my opinions are all five of them are pretty good. Yeah I grew up with Tobey Maguires Spiderman. But I just think Andrew Garfield makes a more superior spider-man. Still a big Spiderman fan no matter what I read most of the comics I have all the movies I have all the games I've seen all the cartoons and the realistic show's. just love Spiderman. But only the people who read comics will agree that Andrew Garfield makes a superior Spiderman.ï»¿

601,"I strongly beg the differ.  I really do like Amazing Spider-Man 2 way more than Spider-man 3.  There's more of a story in ASM2, it just feels connected with the whole Oscorp mystery.  In Spiderman 3, it's an endless string of storylines that don't even go together so it's really hard for us to feel bad for the characters because we're distracted by other things going on (i.e Flint Marko's daughter getting sick, etc.).ï»¿"

Personally, I wish that the film rights belonged to Marvel Studios so Spider-Man could be in The Avengers.ï»¿"

Can you say the reboot follows the comics any better? not exactly! a few things here and there but overall they're not doing any better. Also the acting was great, alfred molina and willem dafoe were way better than the new villains who were pretty mediocre. yes the reboots have nice special effects and spiderman now has jokes still doesn't make it better! :pï»¿"

661,Venom was raped in this movieï»¿
662,Exactly! I hope Raimi comes back to finish what he started. The ending made me want MORE spidey! Raimi come back for the REAL SM4ï»¿
663,Jesse radke The reason why this movie feels so rushed is because he had to change his original script to thisï»¿
664,When i went to see this movie everyone was clapping at the end and people were saying this movie was great so im surprised coming on here and seeing so many people say they didnt like it. Think its just the comic book nerds taking a bitch fit because venom wasnt as good as he should be..ï»¿

666,For me Tobey Maguire will always be The SpidermanÂ ï»¿
667,Honestly the Spider-Man trilogy (2002-2007) was actually my favorite and it was my all time favorite Marvel movie series. But the trilogy did mot follow the comics and a lot of the story line was wrong. The Amazing SpiderMan on the other hand actually carried out the comic origin completely and was actually a really good movie. I mean Andrew Garfield did an amazing job playing Peter. His build actually fits Peter Parker's and he is actually more fit to play the character. Tobey Macquire did a really good job but he was too short and stocky to fit the body type of Peter. They are both excellent movies and they both portray Spider-Man well but I give more props to The Amazing Spider-Man for actually carrying out the comic origin and not completely derailing the story.ï»¿
668,SPIDERMAN 3 HAVEÂ HAVE ALOT OF GOOD ACTION SCENCE BUT THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN 2 IS GOING TO HAVE THE BEST ACTION SENCES AND ITS GOING TO BE THE BEST SPIDERMAN MOVIE IN HISTORY. ITS GOING TO HAVE THE BEST VILLAN LIKE RIHNO AND ELECTRO. I CANT WAIT TO SEE IT ITS COMING OUT MAY 2 2014Â WICH IS TOMORROWï»¿
669,"And another reason why I liked this one 10x better than the new one is actually because of the love story. It's more real, and relatable. Every time peter messed up with mj from the first movie all the way to the last I felt for him. You never really knew what was gunna happen between them. You felt all the effort and how much peter really wanted to be with mj but at times couldn't due to it being another guy or just their personal problems. In the new trilogy peter picks up Gwen literally with no effort needed, it was just like that and no problems what so ever.ï»¿"
670,"Man I love this trilogy so much. I grew up to this, this is literally my child hood in a trilogy, and that is why it upsets me for people just to forget about this and just move on to the new one. It's like the new born baby in the family and everyone forgets about the older sibling.ï»¿"
671,"Mr.Wavy24 same, my brother who was born in 2000 was a fan of the Spider-Man movies, and I was born in 2003 and naturally gained an interest in Spider-Man because my brother used to watch it so much, Iâ€™m now 15 and still get sad when I think about these films because they were my childhood too, and now there goneï»¿"

673,The reason for why they didn't make spider man 4 was because Sam Rami didn't like the story the writers were coming up with and they were running low on timeï»¿

It wasn't overstuffed because amazing spider man 2 handled all those characters great. There should have been 1 Main villain. VENOM and someone else playing him. Have Harry goblin and spiderman have one fight and at the end harry tries to help peter but venom kills him like in the movie. Also DON'T KILL OFF EDDIE BROCK/VENOM. Sam Raimi wonders why he couldn't go anywhere for the 4th one. BECAUSE U KILLED EVERY VILLAIN OFF!!!! Both Goblins, Doc Ock, Venom. Best villains in the franchise. U could have did carnage in 4 if u didn't kill off eddie brock. But I like the new reboot better so  I guess it was meant to beï»¿"

751,@lukestormer45Â Everyone who commented actually The Amazing Spider-Man and Spider-Man are both fine! but i think Spider-Man was a better movie then Amazing Spider-Man and just because TASM has web shooters doesnt mean that movie is more stupidï»¿

794,Oh.ï»¿
795,@TheFreeForeverÂ Thats not the story of what went down at all. It had to do with studio politics. The producers did not like Raimi's direction and forced him to put Venom in the third film. All the arguing with them broke them apart.Â ï»¿

797,No -_- WTFï»¿

800,"Well, i'm from Turkey. Not america or other countryï»¿"
801,"@TheFreeForeverumm no, its Sony's fault, they kept pushing Raimi to make movies that were beneath him, they kept creative control and didn't let raimi do the best he could. so he said fuck it and quit, Tobey quit also. instead of casting a new spidey and director, sony said screw it REBOOT. and thats what happened. sony fucks everything upï»¿"
802,I never want to pop the Spider-Man trilogy into my dvd player because it's boring as hell The Amazing Spider-Man I don't mind re-watching ....you don't buy Maguire and Dunst as a couple...Garfield and Stone is believable....and The Amazing Spider-Man has a way better cast all around. Garfield was an actual Spider-Man comic fan before cast and Maguire didn't care....Garfield is also more attractive and a better actor.ï»¿
803,"@PhlynnÂ Nothing will ever ever ever beat the first spiderman movie, with toby maguire. Even if there are hundreds of remakes reboots or whatever to come, no spiderman movie will ever live up to the one that started the superhero movie trend.ï»¿"
804,"@Yell0wRocketManÂ So, you thought as Peter Parker, Mary Jane and Harry Osborne u bought Toby Maguire and Kristen Dunst as a couple and him and James Franco as besties...Over Garfield and Emma Stone and Dane Dehaan.ï»¿"
805,"@PhlynnÂ yes, it just flowed, as the movies progressed in the trilogy they did, yes, get worse and the character development lacked that special something the first didnt. The reboot movies though, are even worse and theres a lack of intrigue and emotion when you watch particuarly the first one. Would you not agree?ï»¿"
806,Â I bet the same thing is going to be said for the new FF movie this summer.Â ï»¿

823,1:22 peter parker madï»¿
824,"I really don't like that most everyone in the world hated this movie. Me personally - I loved it. I went back to see it seven times - setting a record for most times I'd seen a movie at least until the Dark Knight came out.I feel like there are just some things that people need to get past; for example, I think what most people have a problem with is what I call the ""Filler"" of the movie. But seriously - you shouldn't pay attention to the filler because it's just taking up space before we get back to the plot.Plus - I think the Black Suit was awesome; go see the movie purely for the awesomeness of the Black Suit.Even I don't like how Venom didn't have much screen time in the movie. But...think about it; I feel like if Venom was given a bigger role, it wouldn't have been handled right. I feel like the character would've majorly chewed the scenery. That thought makes me appreciate the ""final boss"" feel they gave him in the movie.ï»¿"
825,"Why did Sam Raimi feel the need to put Sandman in this movie? If he just would focused on New Goblin and Venom the movie would have been far better off. Not to say I didn't enjoy Sandman in this movie, because I did, but to be honest I would rather have a more fleshed out Venom, Goblin, and Gwen Stacey.ï»¿"

Vulture and Doc Oc are more ovious but venom is there so for these reasons I think the villans will occur as such.ï»¿"
833,"I think you might be over-thinking it with the symbiote, isn't it supposed to be something that comes from space, and not an Oscorp experiment? Â Although, seeing how The Amazing Spiderman movies are going for a more serious route, than Sam Raimi's movies, Id o want to see his potrayal of Symbiote Spiderman, Venom and Carnage.Â ï»¿"
834,I agree that the ooze should come from space but seeing the ooze sample in the trailer convinces me it will come from ozcorp :(ï»¿
835,maybe for TASM3 there is going to be sinester six thats why in TASM2 trailer we can see the wings for vulture and the arms for doc octï»¿
836,cool ive always liked the idea of sinister sixï»¿
837,"The Lizard and Rhino should've been in this movie instead of Sandman. Not too sure about New Goblin, but Rhino definitely needed to be in this movie. I doubt Garfield's skinny Spiderman could pull off the epicness of Maguire's black suit Spiderman.Â ï»¿"

839,"Raimi's trilogy will always be the trueÂ Spider-Man to me.Nobody can top Toby Maguire, James Franco, Alfred Molina, Willem Dafoe, J.K. Simmons,Â Dylan Baker, or Thomas Haden Church.They're the definitive movieÂ incarnations of their comic book counterparts.ï»¿"

854,I'm sorry but Peter Parker's actor looks SO much better with those bad boy bangs.ï»¿

856,Yea but New Goblin isn't really a villain. he just wants revenge from spiderman. and rhino is only having a short time as wellï»¿
857,"My opinion:Â Is this the best of the trilogy: Hell NoIs this the worst comic book movie: No, that award goes to ""Batman and Robin""Is it Sam Raimi's fault the movie failed: No, that great ""F*ck you, fans"" goes to Sony studios for interfering with the project too much.Â Overall: The movie would have been better if they saved Venom for the next movie, instead of rushing him in at the last secondÂ ï»¿"
858,"Mine:Is this the best of the trilogy: Heck yes! I LOVED THIS MOVIE!Is this the best comic book movie: Well, The Avengers barely beat it.ï»¿"
859,"It could have been great. Fuck the studio for destroying everything.Â Why did we have to have 20 villains in this movie? And what terrible casting for venom. Who's idea was it to hire That 70's Show? Plus I didn't appreciate the fact that they changed his uncle's killer. Plus it was pretty stupid the police seemed to be sitting on this information for years, but forgot to tell the family until after the man escaped. And fuck the studio again for forcing Raimi to quit, and now we have to live with this as the last Spider man in the series.Â ï»¿"

871,Great point.ï»¿
872,"I agree on the Ben Affleck part because I was quite pleased with his casting, and after seeing his directing in his previous movies I thought it'd be cool if he had some political influence on the script. Keaton has a longer impact, because his role as Batman happened quite a while ago, yet his legacy remains intact. Bale has a more significant impact in my opinion, as he played the role for a longer period of time, and his performance was simply exceptionalï»¿"
873,"I don't think Bale is bad, I just think when it comes down the line 10 or 15 years from now, 5 or more people would have already played a certain character, hence, Batman. As soon as Ben Affleck was announced everyone forgot about Christian Bale and flipped tables, except me, because I like Ben Affleck. I'm not saying Keaton is better because he got there first, I'm saying he has a much longer impact on the greatness he brought. ï»¿"
874,"I think Christian Bale, Andrew Garfield, and Henry Cavill have done a fantastic job as being evidence to the contrary. It's important to remember the past for the sake of respect and even nostalgia, but living in the past, and letting it effect your opinion in present is simply bias.ï»¿"

885,"Carnage was an idea for the forth one, it was suppoused to be for the fifth one thoughï»¿"
886,"The reason that they didn't made the fourth one was because Toby was getting older, they don't know where to put the adult spiderman next and technically they wanted vulture in it not carnageï»¿"
887,the new spiderman sucksï»¿
888,I hope they bring back venom in the new spidey moviesï»¿
889,Yeah. I really thought they could've made a comeback with Spiderman 4. I think Tobey is a much better spiderman than whatever that guy's name is who is on TAS. ï»¿
890,well i respect your opinionï»¿
891,"Let me rephrase what i said, i see why people hate this movie, however, i think that there are some good ideas. MJ finally becomes a  3d character, Harry losing his memory, Sandman's character was good, the effects and action scenes were great and Venom, as i said, i don't think he was fit for this series, with so much going on, he couldn't be the main focus i hope they give him more focus in TAS movies. It's the worst of the 4, no doubt, but i just don't think it's as bad as everyone says.ï»¿"
892,That's because they're combining the Ultimate and Amazing storylines. Go do your research. The Daily Bugle wasn't in there because Peter didn't go there right away in the Ultimate comics. And they glossed his Uncle's killer over because they wanted to make room for possibly finding him in later movies. And I didn't say they were 100% comic accurate either. I just said that they were more accurate. Especially with him not having organic webbing.ï»¿
893,"It's not that hard to understand why people hate this movie. They made a mockery out of the Black suit/Venom storyline, Harry was wasted in this movie, he build up perfectly in the first two movies only to be put in the back burner for fucking Sandman, They ruined the first movie's origin story, the unnesscary dance scenes, was marketed to be the most serious of the three and turned out to be the goofiest. Yes Raimi was forced by Sony that didn't mean he had to punish the fans for wanting Venom.ï»¿"
894,This movie could've been something. ï»¿
895,"Really? I don't remember Uncle Ben's killer still being at large, Don't remember Lizard killing Captain Stacy, Spider-Man seem to learn more from Captain Stacy than Uncle Ben in TASM, The movie glossed over the wrestling part of his origin, Where's Betty Brant. Don't get me wrong I love TASM but it's just as accurate to comics as Raimi's were. The only advantage ASM has over the first two is Peter/Gwen relationship and Spider-Man has more to his personality.ï»¿"
896,"I liked the fact that Venom & Sand Man were in the same installment. In my opinion it made the film a lot more exciting having two major villains of the Spider Man series was brilliant! I remember seeing Spider man 1,2&3 in theaters when I was younger and it was sooo awesome! I will never forget the hype for this trilogy back in the day!ï»¿"
897,"The first trilogy was more old fashioned and maguire was a good 60's spiderman. It had the classic villains like doc ock, green goblin and sandman. Venom was rushed, no doubt, but really, it was better than nothing! I mean, with so much going on, it was hard to fit him in! I find this movie underrsted. I like all three more or less the same, i don't get why so many people hate this movie and love the second one so much!ï»¿"
898,you forget to say arnold schwarzenegger is  terminatorï»¿
899,"I liked this movie. The friendship scenes between Spiderman and Green Goblin was just great. I prefer Toby as Spiderman over the newer actor. Toby gave off more of a ""geeky nerd"" vibe, which Spiderman was meant to be like.ï»¿"
900,Thumbs up if you think this trailer was better then the actual movie.ï»¿
901,WHAT THE FUCK GODZILLA ROAR AT 1:31ï»¿
902,Why the fuck was Venom in this.......he didn't need to beï»¿
903,"I sure hope he is making the sound track! On top of being a bad movie, TAS had a weak score.ï»¿"
904,Well said.ï»¿
905,"Didn't care for The Amazing Spider Man. I mean parts of it were cool, but overall I couldn't understand why they didn't just use Toby Mcquire, Kirsten and the actress that played the aunt and just made the fourth one with Carnage and made it violent to top it off. Re-booting  the movie made no sense. ï»¿"
906,"Yeah, I could never understand why Spider Man 3 fell short from Spider Man 2. It's the same with a lot of movies making only 3 films and making really smart movies that build. Spider Man 3, they could have made 2 movies out of that and had a cliff hanger. ï»¿"
907,"love spider-man 3 and the trilogy,its defiantly better then amazing spider-man!ï»¿"
908,"I haven't read the comics but that doesn't matter. It was a bad movie by movie standards. The accuracy doesn't define the quality of a movie, its supposed to stand as its own.The original trilogy was equally accurate if not more than TASMï»¿"
909,It was only terrible if you haven't read the comics and didn't know that the Amazing movie was far more comicbook accurate than Raimi's movies were. But neither the Raimi movies or the Amazing movie are for kids. They're for young adults and older.ï»¿
910,"This movie had so much potential. It was good in some aspects, but in most, it wasn't. The best thing in my opinion was how they designed the black suit. It was a unique take on its look.ï»¿"
911,LOOOOOOOOOOOOL adult? it was a terrible movie!ï»¿
912,"These Spiderman movies were great kids movies, The Amazing Spiderman is a great adult movie. ï»¿"
913,"Christopher Reeves is SupermanMichael Keaton is BatmanHugh Jackman is WolverineRobert Downey Jr is Iron Manand there is only one Spider-Man, Tobey MaGuire.ï»¿"

924,"Pure truth, amigo!ï»¿"
925,Does anyone know the ending trailer music?ï»¿
926,I like the movie fuck the haters haters GTFOï»¿
927,"meh, i still prefer TASï»¿"
928,TASM = *cough* *cough* gay hipster sk8er Peter parkerï»¿
929,"I think TASM is a better movie, but I don't think this movie was awful. I thought it was good.ï»¿"
930,you and me both.ï»¿
931,Am i the only person who thought The Amazing Spider Man was good? i would even go as far as to say it was better then the first trilogy.ï»¿
932,I'm not a Spider man fan but I loved the original two films. At Christmas my family and I watch a film trilogy. Last year it was LOTR. This trilogy would be a shoe in for this year but the third film is so bad I'm unsure. The Amazing Spider man went nowhere with the story that wasn't covered in the original Spider man.ï»¿
933,"Yeah, me too.ï»¿"
934,The Amazing Spider-Man was not good at all.ï»¿
935,Agreed. I never watched it...ï»¿
936,i dont care what anyone says i love this movieï»¿
937,I would go that far lolï»¿
938,"I loved this movie so much. I think The New Goblin was class, Sandman was boring and Venom was F##KING AWESOME in my opinion, its the best Spider-Man yet, TASM was shit. ï»¿"
939,the other side of this movie is the venom is bornï»¿
940,"""This could be the end of Spider-Man""Oh, the irony.ï»¿"
941,"Not a bad movie at all, i loved it in theaters. Except the bar dance, i feel embarhassed for some reason when i watch it, even when i'm alone... like i'm watchin a chick flick.. but they really know how to make a trailer, when i first saw it i got soo excitedï»¿"
942,"The thing with this movie was it was great but pretty bad at the same time. I mean I was enjoying watching up until the emo spidey. The bar dance scene pretty much made me feel like I was watching the movie Chicago (2002) and not spiderman because it felt nothing like spiderman what so ever. But when about fifteen minutes go on it renames itself  back to spiderman but when everyone walked out of the theatre everyone was like ""Remember when spiderman goes emo what the fuck was that all about""ï»¿"
943,"Sony didnt give the time to finish to movie .Sony hired some shitty writers ,Sam Raimi rejected all stupid plots,(you can found some of them in the internet)he wanted to make Spider-Man 4 so much better than all 3 movies. he created a epic cast but it didnt work out . In the end he said fuck off to Sony ,Sony said fuck off to him .FIN ï»¿"
944,"Lot of comic book whiner will disagree but yeah I agree . It was really entertaining movie ,fun to watch ,sad (end),story is great (ignore the MJ scenes),it had epic action scenes,epic soundtrack and loved black suit scenes.Movie had serious flaws but personally I loved it .ï»¿"
945,Are you crazy?ï»¿
946,It really was!ï»¿
947,Noï»¿
948,WHY THE FUCK DID THEY GO BACK TO THE FIRST SPIDERMAN 1 ORIGONAL STORY IN TAS THEY SHOULD HAVE MADE SPIDERMAN 4 WTF IS WRONG WITH THEM!!!!ï»¿
949,Which was sony's fault. ï»¿
950,Electro sucksï»¿
951,Wtf how is he too old? He's only 38.ï»¿
952,Where's Spider-Man 3.1?ï»¿
953,"""This could be the end of spiderman""How did he know?ï»¿"
954,tobby mguire is way to old to be spiderman ï»¿
955,"i know, the amazing spiderman is shit, i remember my mom telling me ''do you want to go see the new spiderman movie?'' im like YESSSS but when i look into it i just get pissed offï»¿"
956,They are all cool in their own way. We each have characters that we like...ï»¿
957,CARNAGE SUCKS Venom and Electro Are cool to...ï»¿
958,???? You know it was rebooted Amazing Spiderman was bad ass and more comicy.ï»¿
959,? 1:31ï»¿
960,"""This could be the end for spiderman"" lol the news reporter knew it way beforeï»¿"
961,"Spiderman 3 holds the current record of most expensive film cost to make, at an approx $258million... ITS RUBBISH! ï»¿"
962,but i still like itï»¿
963,"We should have gotten spiderman 4 with the script that sam raimi wanted instead of the amazing spiderman, but that's just my opinion.ï»¿"
964,Next Movie needs to have Carnage :D and they should somehow bring Venom back instead of use Electro.ï»¿
965,yes :P it sucks that he cant be killed -.-ï»¿
966,I like this one. There were a few things that i didnt like but overall i think this movie was still good. I prefer normans goblin to harrys portrayal of the green goblin though. And i think the first and second were better than this one but i dont hate it and i still think its really goodï»¿
967,"They shouldn't have ever included sandman, it ruined the movieï»¿"
968,"Spiderman 1 and 2 were amazing. To be honest though, I didn't like this onrï»¿"
969,Wanna know the Top 10 Worst Things In Hollywood? No? Well that doesn't matter! Check out my channel for Hollywood news with a vlog twist! Here's a sample video! youtube.com/watch?v=_kvm91MmVV0ï»¿
970,Spiderman 1 was the best!!ï»¿
971,"i serioulsy love spiderman and i like the new remake of spiderman as well but what got on my nerves is how in the avengers they dont put spiderman in it, like seriously why not!!ï»¿"
972,"If only the movie was like this trailer, the end results would have been different.ï»¿"
973,This movie gave me chronic diarrhea ï»¿
974,I love all the spider man movies ! There all my favorite!:)ï»¿
975,Its not good... wasnt bad either... just like T3. :)ï»¿
976,Saying that by watching the trailer of the worst Spider-Man movie in history ? Its hard to take you seriously.ï»¿
977,"I love all the spider-man movies, even The Amazing Spiderman. I am really excited for the amazing spiderman 2ï»¿"
978,these films r way better thanTASï»¿
979,They made Peter Parker into an emo little bitch smh -__- but overall it was an ok movieï»¿
980,"Sorry to tell you this, but Spider-Man 3 ruined your favorite super hero.:/ï»¿"
981,"Two things: People who clicked like when the trailer was released but the film wasn't out yet, and the people who would watch the trailer now are the people who liked the film, so that's a somewhat bias statistic there. If I were to do a vote outside of this video, there's a chance that the statistics would be very different. The only reason I'm on this vid was to find the old beta trailer that had an awesome venom roar, before they replaced it with a high pitch shriek.ï»¿"
982,This movie really wasn't that bad...ï»¿
983,*cough* *cough* emo peter parker..ï»¿
984,yeahï»¿
985,Wasn't it amazing how they didn't even show Venom in this trailer for a split second? I loved that because he actually plays such a big role in the movie in my opinion and it was sort of like a nice surprise the first time I watched.ï»¿
986,"2:08 , this was the end of spider-man :( ï»¿"
987,"critics dont mean shit because no one ever goes looking at them. if this movie was bad everyone would be talking about that and since your the only one who is.i guess that means your dead wrong. read all the comments here and its shocking to find your the only person convinced and trying to convince other its bad. your pathetic and wasting your time if you think anyone is going to waste their time listening to you.im done talking, go find someone else stupid enough to argue with your stupid viewï»¿"
988,EpicFuck the new spidermanï»¿
989,"i'll have to say the like bar disagrees with you and so do i. if nearly 90%( 1642/1872) of the people who voted said your wrong then its just as simple as it is: ""YOUR WRONG"". whether you think it's overrated or not, the public speaks for its self.  i dont have to, so there you have it.ï»¿"
990,"Then that I can forgive, at least then Raimi would have had the chance to write him properly than just shoehorn him in at the last 20 minutes.ï»¿"
991,"The film's overrated. Having multiple bad guy's in film, doesn't automatically make it good, especially if the villains themselves were rushed in. Then having parker go flat out stupid in his 'bad guy persona' moment is just terrible writing. No love went into making this film and it shows.ï»¿"
992,I think we shall all vote on the old spider-man on the new one. Like up for the old one.   Dislike for the new one.ï»¿
993,I think we can all agree that the trailers and teasers for this movie were better then the actual movie itself. ï»¿
994,i know i was pissed when i figured out it wasnt a 4thï»¿
995,"this is my favorite movie, positive that this is the greatest movie everï»¿"
996,trailers r better than moviesï»¿
997,"Some people didn't like this movie, but I didn't think it was bad at all. My main gripe is too much Sandman, not enough Venom.ï»¿"
998,Well......maybe...ï»¿
999,"Exactly. The Amazing Spider-Man wasn't really Spider-Man, it was more like 'Lizard Guy Vs. Teen Kid"".ï»¿"
1000,My problem with this film is how quickly venom is beat. I mean one of Spidermans biggest villains and he only gets to be in part of the movieï»¿
1001,Cause ppl dont think like you? ï»¿
1002,spiderman 4ï»¿
1003,amazing spiderman is awesome. ï»¿
1004,I know. But still it's bogus that Spider-Man 3 is hated on.ï»¿
1005,You cant compare Spider man and Batman like that.... its not the same kind of darkness at allï»¿
1006,"Spiderman 1-3 are great movies and they don't use bad words like ""fuck"" ""shit"" ""bitch""... That made the movies special and fun. And The Amazing Spiderman this movie ruined our true hero Tobey the real Spiderman. We want Spiderman 4!ï»¿"
1007,"I completely understand and agree, however if that were to happen they would need to bring back Tobey McQuire (sorry if I spelt his name wrong.) It's a shame because he can't recreate that desired youthfulness that the character of Spider-Man requires. This is because Spider-Man in the alternate Ego of Peter Parker who attends school. Not only that but they need to be able to portray youthful charm that Tobey McQuire just can't offer any more. :)ï»¿"
1008,"This movie had its flaws, but its still my favorite Spiderman movie. BTW I'm with everyone on the ""Emo Peter"" thing. -_-ï»¿"
1009,he wanted to put him spiderman 4 but the studio wanted him in 3ï»¿
1010,fuck you shithead. your one of those people in life who are never satisfied with anything despite the tremendous effort behind it. this movie was perfect. the fact that it had 2 villains made i even why better for me. so take your pessimistic comments and get lost. this world only has room for optimistic people.    ï»¿
1011,We want Spiderman 4! :'(Please! You ruined my fav superhero with the amazing spiderman.ï»¿
1012,"This film pissed me off to no extent at the time, not only did they make sandman a complete pansy, but it basicly put venom in the corner and said 'He's not important'. What a crock. Sam Raimi did go on record saying he hated venom, but if that was the case he shouldn't have put him in the film at all.ï»¿"
1013,"Next movie should have Carnage instead lf Electro, Carnage us completely bad ass.ï»¿"
1014,Action overview for Spiderman 3 at HOWMUCHACTION.BLOGSPOT.COMï»¿
1015,Interesting how they left out any mention of the ridiculous farce that is 'emo Peter' ...ï»¿
1016,"They should have just left venom for maybe 4 or 5, with spiderman fighting in his red and blue against sandman. Then a whole story for venom. Maybe 4 with lizard because hte relationship between pete and curt had been developed enough for it to make impactï»¿"
1017,"Well, the reason he was dancing around New York was because of that black evil substance. It was messing him up.ï»¿"
1018,well the main problem i think was that they made spiderman a crying emo dancing around in the Streets and that isnt realy dark.and they made sandman the actual killer of uncle ben what was also kinda stupid.this is coming from somebody who actually liked spiderman 3.ï»¿
1019,Happy birthday Tobey!ï»¿
1020,Fuck all the haters. I loved this movie.ï»¿
1021,I love tris movie is the bestï»¿
1022,the scene at 1:41 with the black suit was not in the actual movieï»¿
1023,"Yeah..Marplatense is right...the spiderman in this trilogy was hella boring. And how is the movie following the comic boring? Its like saying movies with directors are boring. Besides, many people hated this movie but with a passion not just for hating it. Spidey in this film was a crybaby and was too cheesy. The music was kinda bad but still...you don't know how superhero movies work so you should stop watching or else....haters are gonna kick your ass my friend..don't say I didn't warn you...ï»¿"
1024,"this really WAS the end of spiderman...then this new douchy, sporty, hair gelled, skateboarding, smartphoning, ""cool"" guy comes in and calls himself amazingï»¿"
1025,tobe maguire RULES fuck andrew garfieldï»¿
1026,I loved the movieï»¿
1027,I LOVE THIS MOVIE :)ï»¿
1028,"FUCK ALL THOSE HATERS THAT HATED THIS MOVIE, IT WAS AWESOME SUCK A DICK!!ï»¿"
1029,movie fucking suckedï»¿
1030,Where is Venom?ï»¿
1031,thanx hahahaï»¿
1032,"I thought it was alright, but not good. but i have reasonsConvoluted story, and too many villains, Peter Parker crying did not make me feel bad for him, sort made me feel embarrassed. Also, he was emo in the movie, he's not supposed to be emo, just more aggressive and the dance was stupid. Those are just my reasons for not liking Spider-man 3, the other ones were epic ï»¿"
1033,F5's coming!ï»¿
1034,"It was bloated and silly. Too many villains and plot threads so Sam Raimi couldn't deal with all of them.Not the worst film ever but it was just a mess, especially compared to Spider-Man 2 which was excellent.ï»¿"
1035,Why did people hate this movie so much? I loved it! The bit where Peter is dancing down the street makes me laugh everytimeï»¿
1036,you sir is hilarious ï»¿
1037,wait wait wait. theyre gonna be 5 amazing spidermna?ï»¿
1038,oh the good old days <3 i love it.ï»¿
1039,nopeï»¿
1040,i like the second one better but i love this tooï»¿
1041,"well the director did put him in cause of the demands from the fans,and he sure did look awesome!ï»¿"
1042,? tobey Maguire is awesome. what are you talking about.ï»¿
1043,what?ï»¿
1044,"i love this one too i even have a poster, but i like the second one more because of dr octopus(hes my favorite spiderman villain ) ï»¿"
1045,"nope not great only ""ok"" if you wanna know what I think look at sams review at this its what I think. heres the link /watch?v=GFVCKNWm3ssï»¿"
1046,-_- just stop it. the movie is good (better than amazing spiderman atleast)emo peter is like the only thing that they did wrong the dance scene was bad too but srsly its a good movie. not as good as spiderman 2Â´(spiderman 2 is awesome) ï»¿
1047,Thank you. you and the nostalgia critic is the only persons that I know the likes itï»¿
1048,Am I the only one that Actually liked this movieï»¿
1049,"Being more accurate to the comics makes the new film dumb? that's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Plot points and character behavior from the comics can work in a film. If you want proof watch the Dark Knight Trilogy, they are accurate to the comics and they are very good films, your argument is invalid.So you even loved the third one?... the one that EVERYBODY hated with a passion?You didn't watch many Superhero flicks did you? there are better films than the Spider-Man trilogy, you know?ï»¿"
1050,thats because in batman bruce wayne doesnt go all emo and strut down the street like a retardï»¿
1051,I just feel as if they could have done a better job for this movie...ï»¿
1052,i totally agree awesome movie!ï»¿
1053,me too i agree!ï»¿
1054,i agree!ï»¿
1055,awesome movie to the trilogy!ï»¿
1056,the amazing spider-man was great!ï»¿
1057,"He's just giving his opinion, but I do like spiderman myself.ï»¿"
1058,"I don't care what anyone says, SPIDER-MAN 3 WAS A GOOD MOVIE! They just tried to incorporate a dark storyline into it. Apparently people accept it with Batman, but not Spider-Man? COME ONE! GIVE SPIDER-MAN 3 A BREAK!ï»¿"
1059,"I hate it when his mask gets torn, everyone can see you face, so just take the freaking thing off!ï»¿"
1060,best to worst  1. spider-man 2  2. spider-man 3  3. spider-man 1 4. the amazing spider-man ï»¿
1061,what are you talking about? tasm is damn fine.ï»¿
1062,Why does sandman have Godzilla's roar?ï»¿
1063,"if that so, maybe ""amazing"" which means a people like him would become superhero and will save citizens for no cost in justice, that will be ""amazing"".just in my opinionhope dosent attack any one who love the amazing spiderman.ï»¿"
1064,"it's just too many things that i dont like that film, even is following the comics stories, I still think the film what we watched today wasnt the hero we know, just more like a normal annoying kid when he gets the super power what should he do, if the people like him also can become a superhero, may be the ""amazing"" title is suits here, because people like him can become a hero? a hero must know what is responsibility, and he dosent know at allï»¿"
1065,"even it is following the comics stories, I dont think is a good idea, the amazing spiderman is too annoying, too much annoying dialoge, and it dosent make spiderman look like""amazing"", it makes me feel like a annoying dumb 17 years old kid were so freaking lucky in his whole life, and so he dosent really trying helping citizens, his goal is to find the people who killing uncle ben, so how is he trying helping citizens? ï»¿"
1066,"the amazing spiderman film was dumb, the spiderman1~3 was the best film ever watched, the new one is kinda boring and sleepy, even is following the story of the comics was still dumb, dosent suits to movie I think. Movie is movie, comic is comic, cant place together and coment them together, is just kinda stupid when we doing like this, in my opinion i love the spiderman 1~3 film, is the best super hero movie ever watched, but the new one is too bored, and makes me sleepy.ï»¿"
1067,I over all enjoyed this film. But I think that Venom should have been bigger.ï»¿
1068,These were the best Spider-Man'sï»¿
1069,damn it venom. ï»¿
1070,I noticed that all spiderman movies release on mayï»¿
1071,I miss toby mcguireï»¿
1072,Beauty lies within the eye of the beholderï»¿
1073,"I dunno, Spider Man 3 was kinda.....anticlimactic. I didn't like how Venom was a villain for a good 2-5 minutes. He deserved more screen timeï»¿"
1074,spider man 3 and iron man 3 are the 2 best movies i have ever seen :))))))))ï»¿
1075,that's cause that was the original version of the lizard.ï»¿
1076,"why did people have negative comments on this movie, its brilliant as well as the entire trilogy. TASM had barely action and a horrible view of the lizardï»¿"
1077,Spider man 2 was my fav but I do love this oneï»¿
1078,The only thIng rong with this movie was the fluidity it shold have been longer to balance that. Oh and emo Peter he should have just been angry.ï»¿
1079,"No ! Please just stop . I loved TASM movie just like the others but its uncomparable to Spider-Man 2 . TASM has so many mistakes and wasted potential and wasted villian .Spider-Man 3 is alright ,maybe its painful to see by becoming a comic book fan but its really good in my opinion . All the movies are good but Spider-Man 2 has everything . ï»¿"
1080,"Spider-Man 3 was the worst out of all of them. I am a fan of both series, so I love the Tobey series and the Andrew series. But, I have to say I like the tobey series just a tiny bit more only because they made a trilogy and we've seen all of the movies. Plus, the action scenes (with three as the exception) were amazing!ï»¿"
1081,The Amazing Spider-Man from 2012 beats this entire spiderman trilogy of Sam Raimi's by far!!!ï»¿
1082,oh i still get the feels i had the first time i saw this trailerï»¿
1083,Amazin spiderman sucked. This movie even though it had its problems.was way better than that new crapï»¿
1084,"2:07 Well, fuck he wasn't kidding. ï»¿"
1085,Anybody who says Spiderman 3 is the best has an automatically invalid opinion :Pï»¿
1086,they fucked up making pete and venom metro sexuals.ï»¿
1087,even this is better than the amazing spidermanï»¿
1088,best movie!!! everï»¿
1089,no it wasnt new one sucked the trilogy is the best!ï»¿
1090,so what be patienceï»¿
1091,you are right!ï»¿
1092,Today is the 6 year anniversary! RIP the good old days.ï»¿
1093,You guys are stupid!! The new one was way betterï»¿
1094,This shit is way better than the fucking new Spiderman shit! FUCK I want the old spiderman!ï»¿
1095,BEST MOVIE EVERï»¿
1096,no probs.ï»¿
1097,spider man is my favourte character in any movieï»¿
1098,"Really good film. The action scenes were great, I laughed at several points, good story, fast paced. I just wish I got more venom. ï»¿"
1099,wasnt that good but i went ahead and watched this again last year..not as bad as i remember..damn near classic compared to the new amazing spider-man filth..have we just gotten this dumb? how is that a good movie? its so bad. ï»¿
1100,Marvel: Spiderman and Hellboy >>> ALLï»¿
1101,Really good ending was shit thoughï»¿
1102,no u areï»¿
1103,"this movie was good, stop hatingï»¿"
1104,"Webb will use venom if venom is introduced as harry, and then green goblin and venom vould team up for the third movie, tht would be pretty awesome.ï»¿"
1105,Why wouldn't Mark Webb use Venom?ï»¿
1106,"Oh, I thought you meant we won't see Venom at all in the trilogy. I think he may be in 3 too but wouldn't it be a bit repetitive? I mean, we saw Venom in the last third installment and we'll see him in this too? They already have Norman Osborn (Probably turning to the Green Goblin in either the second movie or third movie) and then we'll also have Venom? They already used them. It would be a bit too soon to reuse them, right? Maybe they'll use Carnage? That would be awesome.ï»¿"
1107,why?ï»¿
1108,This shit was worse than the Saltine challenge.ï»¿
1109,"I know the stuff with emo Peter was bad, but besides that, I found this film enjoyable to say the least.ï»¿"
1110,S3 is meh..ï»¿
1111,"in Spiderman Green Goblin was a psychopathic mass murderer, in Spiderman 2 Dr. Octopus almost destroys an entire city, and in Spiderman 3 Venom and Sandman kidnap Mary Jane only to fuck spidey... what an epic ending...ï»¿"
1112,This trailer is better then the goddamn movieï»¿
1113,"Amazing Spider-Man wasn't that much better, either. ï»¿"
1114,Tobey still made a great Spider-Man I say and I'm still a fan of the Rami movies.  ï»¿
1115,Where can i buy drugs that make people so badass?ï»¿
1116,Damn this trailer was so awesome it foreshadowed a really cool movie but really was mixed with a lot of weird comedy.ï»¿
1117,This movie sucked...amazing spiderman was my favoriteï»¿
1118,"Seriously, if Venom were placed early in the movie, he wouldn't have much to do. I love Raimi's trilogy. The reboot is decent. I don't think it's a masterpiece.ï»¿"
1119,if you liked sam riami's movies better than marc webb's you are just an idiotï»¿
1120,shitiest superhero movie ever !ï»¿
1121,sir you are an idiotï»¿
1122,Spider man movies in my opinionSpider Man: AwesomeSpider Man 2: BetterSpider Man 3: Outstanding!!!!Amazing Spider Man: Meh...ï»¿
1123,I was looking so forward for it too come out and when I saw it I was so disappointed.ï»¿
1124,This movie was so disappointing.ï»¿
1125,Iron Man is awsomerï»¿
1126,I think most of us are really disappointed in SM 3 cause Venom is a favorite villain to all and he got like 20min time in the movie. I think if they took out Sandman and kept it just about Venom and Harry would've been a hit like SM 1 and 2. All that time wasted on love drama and Sandman could've been developing Eddie. I mean come on they turned Spidey cries all the time and it's more about MJ and him then any of the villains or fighting them...That's the reasons for me the movie wasn't as good.ï»¿
1127,"I don't think he sucks but I know what you mean, Toby Maguire was an excellent spidey - looks geeky enough and in the same time he's cute. I don't know Andrew was good but not better to me, the costume looked really weird on his body I don't know why...ï»¿"
1128,This could be the end of Spider-Man...your telling me...ï»¿
1129,"watch?v=M-yoghg3OAI&list=FLvU8Oo-lAX9pyCQpUk9ne5gnot spam, related to this video. worth watchingï»¿"
1130,We need spider man 4 alreadyï»¿
1131,"Well I still enjoyed this movie,even though it was a bit congested.ï»¿"
1132,"Sorry to be interupting you, but think of the fact, that the venom makes his wearer more stronger.. So, if you would ask me, I would claim that the black spider man (with the venom suit) is stronger than the red one, even him self admitted it ""The suit ? The POWER "". The more power you have, the stronger you are. Lets say, that Spider Man has for example Y power, Now, lets do some math :D Y + POWER > Y :DBest statement I have ever claimed 8-)ï»¿"
1133,Spoiler alert : Spiderman rescue Mary Jane at the end (once again)!! 2012 spiderman for the winï»¿
1134,"My first ever video is now on my channel, a fan trailer for 'Venom'!ï»¿"
1135,Trinity by James Dooleyï»¿
1136,"the trailer was the only good thing about this movie. i'm sorry but i was a huge fan of the franchise till number 3 :(( Yet, tobey is still my spiderman, spiderman 2 was d best, the amazing spider-man, idk about it, it was good, but a little dark ish. Hope the amazing spiderman 2 is good. ï»¿"
1137,"you have to admit, Venom, Green Goblin, Sandman, all of them on one scene. That was freakin' coolï»¿"
1138,Movie 1 was great. Movie 2 was awesome. One of the best superhero movies of all time. Movie 3 was... Okay.ï»¿
1139,"""This could be the end of Spider-Man."" It was... Sam Raimi's trilogy.ï»¿"
1140,"Cause sony are money hungry little shits and knew that if they made sam put Venom in SM3 EVERYBODY would go crazy and try there hearts out to go see it regardless of whether or not they did justice to the character or not, which was why SM3 made the most money out of the trilogy but got the worst reviews.ï»¿"
1141,Great effects and action but the love story aspects slow the film to a standstill.ï»¿
1142,2:01 that part always gaves me goosebumpsï»¿
1143,still better than batman and robinï»¿
1144,i dont get it? why people are saying this one of the worsest movie ever made.it dosent win TASM but this is amazing too.ï»¿
1145,One of the most Intense Trailers of all time! But being A Huge Spiderman Fan that I am I have to admit the Movie was very Disappointing.ï»¿
1146,Whats the name of the song that plays during the trailer?ï»¿
1147,i'm 16 but it's been a while since the last time i saw itï»¿
1148,"When you get older you'll understand, I did.ï»¿"
1149,4th may 2007 Ä± miss ï»¿
1150,So you're saying you search youtube to watch an old trailer to a movie that you think is a piece of shit. you're life must be excitingï»¿
1151,"this movie has alot of good messages, while the amazing spidershit tried to tell me teenage love is stronger than a man's wish on his death bed -_-ï»¿"
1152,"I enjoyed both :/Seriously, I agree that Spider-Man 3  was dissapointing after the shock that was Spider-Man 2, but I wouldn't go to the point of calling it an ""AWFUL piece of shit"" oOBatman & Robin is an awful piece of shit, Dragon Ball Evolution is an awful piece of shit ; Spider-Man 3 isn't. It still has a lot of qualities to make it a good movie overall.The thing is, it was announced like the ultimate super-hero movie that you would ever see, talk about a huge letdown.ï»¿"
1153,i miss the movieï»¿
1154,"I know that the suit changes him and that's fine. That could've been a great plot device and made for a great story arc. However, like you said, they could've had him just being an ass to MJ, instead of just acting like a freak to everyone and doing some outdated jazz dance to show how ""edgy"" he is. They REALLY missed on that.ï»¿"
1155,oh ok. well... first time i saw it i was like 9 or 10 so maybe that's why i liked it.ï»¿
1156,"Same. What everybody calls the bad scenes, like Emo-Peter, i personally find just super hillarious. People seem to be confused that a Superhero movie can be comedy and romance too.ï»¿"
1157,"Hm, stupid but in one sense it reflected how the symbiote was affecting him. That stuff changes you and what we deem to be a bit stupid is exactly what the suit does. Classic Venom is a little crazy to be honest. But no yeah, if Venom wasn't where, we would have that. It was a pitiful attempt at humour; they could have just had him being a douche to MJ instead.I think Venom was a huge issue with this film, Rami wanted to leave him out, but nah, people wanted money and said to have him in.ï»¿"
1158,wow.. you must like REALLY shitty movies if they all have jumbled colliding plots. 3 years? wow! so THAT means the movie is good??? you're so smart! :]ï»¿
1159,What is the sandman's limit of how much he can absorb?ï»¿
1160,i don'T uderstand what people didn't like about the movieï»¿
1161,emo peter parker for the loss.ï»¿
1162,yeah. i loved emo peter.. the fucking lame ass dance seen and the millions of plots all colliding together and super rushed. this movie sucked. no opinion there. venom needs an entire fucking series to be fleshed out. ï»¿
1163,"Bitch please, I am spider-man.ï»¿"
1164,"That's pretty much what I thought too. Get rid of Venom and give Sandman a bigger part and it would've vastly improved 3. Also, get rid of the ridiculous jazz number that Peter does at the club. That was just fucking stupid.ï»¿"
1165,Spider-Man 3 is my guilty pleasure. ï»¿
1166,So you're saying you enjoyed this AWFUL piece of shit but you didn't like TASMï»¿
1167,"to be honest the entire trilogy was amazing, including the third, until it reached the ending with peter and mj dancing, i wish it ended differently, maybe like the ending of the other two previouslyï»¿"
1168,"... the same person got negative votes, replied to their comment, and got thumbs up? wha...?ï»¿"
1169,I missed these Spiderman movies... Amazing spiderman sucks!!ï»¿
1170,such a dramatic trailer... shame about the goofy filmï»¿
1171,"Someones probably said this before....But like I read up that like the people above Raimi wanted to make sure Venom was in the film. They knew a lot of fans wanted to see Venom. I think what Raimi didn't like though was having it predictable. He later said he didn't want to have Venom because there were other villains that he could portray much better, for example Sandman.Just the people above wanted all the money they could get, and so selling Venom in hype made sure they got their money.ï»¿"
1172,"I agree, i cant believe sane people still like this shit, any of them. you cant troll a movie simply coz its a reboot. spidey fans just cant accept theres a better film out thereï»¿"
1173,This movie is still a billion times better than that AWFUL Amazing Spider-Man shit.ï»¿
1174,U R AN IGNORANT BIGOTï»¿
1175,"I don't deny this, do you? I serve God, and you?ï»¿"
1176,AND U R A TROLLï»¿
1177,AND U R A TROLLï»¿
1178,01:31 godzilla roar niceï»¿
1179,"If he was being sarcastic he would have said something like, Thanks for respecting my opinion 'you nob' something like that SO DNT TELL ME ABOUT SARCASTIC U DUMBASSï»¿"
1180,But it was not and it is my opinion just like Spider-Man 3 is your opinion and yes do mean the show from the 70's i know i watch the series the cartoons and all 4.movies. Ok i got it and i understand you only repeated what i said to @marcules2 tough i was not talking to you.ï»¿
1181,"Yes i did i say all that,but i never said i hate the new movie i said i did not like some things in the movie and yes i was bored by that movie i was bored it is boring movie, again you are twisting my words around i did not say it was a piece of shit any of the Spider-Man movies stop twisting my words around. Oh i never said it is pieces of Shit any of the Spider-Man movie but you know what? The Amazing Spider-Man could be much much better  made than it was or Spider-Man 1,2 and 3.    ï»¿"
1182,AND YOU ARE A BIGOTï»¿
1183,U R A BIGOTï»¿
1184,What? You mean that TV show from the 70's? That has nothing to do with the movie. And I never said anything bad to you either. I just basically repeated what you originally said to @marcules2. ï»¿
1185,"Yes you did say you hated the Amazing Spider-Man movie. If I recall correctly you called it the most boring, awful movie you have ever seen in your entire live. That sounds like you think it's a piece of shit to me.ï»¿"
1186,@William Boske And i did not said one bad word to @marcules2 because he likes the new movie and this one and i even apologized to him for my behalf what i said before unlike you. Why you getting to likes when your attacking me on internet . Again The amazing Spider-Man was already made before in 60's or 70's somewhere there i am really no sure and i don't care. ï»¿
1187,@William Boske And you are bashing me and @Mike O'Connell and Spider-Man 3 I did not say neither once that The Amazing Spider-Man is piece of shit you start it and all movies are well made they are all different a  Spider-Man and if you did not noticed The Amazing Spider-man was made before.   ï»¿
1188,He was being sarcastic dumbass.ï»¿
1189,Oh your welcome man Nd sorry for the swears lolï»¿
1190,"Thanks for respecting my OPINION. As I am, yours.ï»¿"
1191,"I agree. I thought Garfield really was in the avengers when you said that he shouldn't be,but than i checked on  IMDb but he wasn't thank god and i agree if they put Spider-Man in The Avengers 2 it should be Tobey Maguire. I agree with you. ï»¿"
1192,Well you're the one who was clearly bashing @marcules2 for liking The Amazing Spider-Man over this movie. I wasn't telling you to not like the Sam Raimi trilogy I just think The Amazing Spider-Man was a better movie overall than one.ï»¿
1193,Look i am sorry about what i said to you i agree with you they are all good movies. None is a bad Is just i did not like some things in the new movie when they changed i saw the trailer i couldn't wait to see The New Amazing Spider - Man is got me bored fro 2.hrs and i have expect much better in that movie. ï»¿
1194,"Who said that I don't like this movie. I really like it, I only suggest that the other movies was better. Overall, every Spiderman movie is good. Not a masterpice, not even a piece of crap, only good :)ï»¿"
1195,Garfield was in the avengers? ï»¿
1196,Yes i like this movie why is that so wrong? can i not be a Spider-Man fan? Just asking you.  ï»¿
1197,"If you think that, good for you :)ï»¿"
1198,No! I am not on a drugs!  I am been Spider-Man fan my whole life and i have many reasons why i love this movie. I love all three movies and i don't care what you say about this movie but do not tell me not to be fan of Spider-Man or Sam Raimi's trilogy cause i will always chose Raimi's movies. The Amazing Spider-Man is the best one to you? than watch it and don't bash me or convince me otherwise cause i love Spider-man 3. ï»¿
1199,I think you're the one on drugs buddy. The Amazing Spider-Man was a great movie ten times better than this piece of shit.ï»¿
1200,Except this one.ï»¿
1201,I love this movie â™¥ Tobey Maguire fits as Peter Parker ï»¿
1202,Crdeedï»¿
1203,Ftyï»¿
1204,and the music at 0:19 is...ï»¿
1205,i like i too it is no masterpiece but it still is a fun timeï»¿
1206,"BTW MJ wasn't his first love and Venom didn't die the first time they fought. He was sent went to prison. And there's where he meets Kasady how else would they make Carnage otherwise unless they again destroy the facts again. Books I get it, ok not much but imagination left to figure out how to make in a movie but comics - it's already made and people expect it like that if you're gonna make it into movie. Point is all the movies are good but they lack facts (SM) or are missing vision (TASM)!ï»¿"
1207,Andrew Garfield is rather cute but not geeky enough. But both movies fucked up major villains: SM3 with Venom...no comment on that shit he looked like black Carnage not Venom and there's the difference he also deserved to have bigger part in the movie or like someone else said here before shoud've been left alone for SM4. TASM with The Lizard - where is his face?? He had the long mouth like a reptile cause that's what he is!ï»¿
1208,"Tobey was the ultimate spidey, cause Parker is supposed to be a lab geek, look like that, sound like that and no offence to Tobey but he did it good. Spider-man having doubts of himself and being sarcastic about it but also a bit bitter some times, still feeling like a geek even with his powers that's Spider-man! As director Raimi did better job than Webb but exaggerated every story he picked up from the comics and there was the disappointment. Webb followed most of the facts and that I respect.ï»¿"
1209,"I'm a girl. I have an older brother and grew up with Sonic the Hedgehog, Pokemon, Mario, Spiderman,  and YouTube. I was encouraged to play video games and read comic books. I loved every moment I spent watching Spidey fight off Doc Ock and save Mary Jane. I treasure and reread all my super hero comic books, which I keep hidden in a drawer in my closet. Don't get me wrong, I like girly stuff, but I will forever love Spiderman. He's my childhood hero.ï»¿"
1210,The new one is ok lolï»¿
1211,i remember seeing this on trailer on movie.com or something. and i watched it 10000 timesï»¿
1212,i â™¥ toby mcguire. i watched the 2 one today. i hate kirsten dunst now.ï»¿
1213,I'm want to see the black-suit in the next amazing spider-man movie =)  ï»¿
1214,Back when spiderman was badass......ï»¿
1215,"Even though I thought Venom was rushed in because of Sony's damn pressure; I liked this movie. For me, Sam Raimi's trilogy is perfect.ï»¿"
1216,"I must say, this one is the worst spiderman movie ever. Don't get me wrong. i love tobey maguire acting performance, he's better than andrew garfield by far. Spiderman 1 and 2 is still the best and The amazing spider man is pretty good except for the lame lovestory. The amazing spiderman 2, make it happen. andrew garfield really nid to start actin more spidey and new mary jane actors :Dï»¿"
1217,why do ppl commet on this movie from years agoï»¿
1218,i love this movie too dont understand the hate that it gets.ï»¿
1219,"Sorry but , I LOVE THIS MOVIE!ï»¿"
1220,why it looks like a cartoon ? The CGI is bad !ï»¿
1221,"I think that this movie was actually about Spiderman, and not Venom. And to be fair, I think we saw enough of Venom, cause venom technically is the black suited spiderman aswell. So what im trying to say is, Fuck you sir and all the other people who complained about this movie because This movie was fucking beast, best out of the 3 infact. The amazing spiderman was great but it needs more movies to top this one.. so nuff saidï»¿"
1222,"The movie could have been far worse, but the one thing that really bugged me in this film was (surprise, surprise) Venom. Everyone got so exited to see him in live-action and all we get in the 2 scenes he's in is a peeled-back stretchy looking Topher Grace face with spiked teeth. Why did they hire Sam Raimi as the director for the first movie when he doesn't like Venom?ï»¿"
1223,"I don't care what anyone says, I loved this film. Great way to end the trilogy.ï»¿"
1224,Even if they had split it up I still don't think it would've been very good. The problem for me was the alternate story line they gave the Sandman. They should've either left him out or just use him as a more minor distraction. Like a secondary villain who just keeps showing up at the worst possible moments. Something like that could've made this movie at least a little bit better.ï»¿
1225,Worst Spider-Man ever it was all old clips from Spider-Man 2 WTFï»¿
1226,True and it added way too much! This movie can be divided into 2 movies because of all the crazy things that was happening. Next time Sony should amke a movie only about venom and not add all these storylines that ruin sm3.ï»¿
1227,Worst Venom EVER.ï»¿
1228,"Okay now I can agree with you.I think what ruined this movie for me though was that it had the potential to be better. It's obvious that Venom was just a throw in, and unfortunately the Sandman bits were a really bad idea.I think James Franco was the salvation to this movie. The acting was all really good (Except for the chick who played Gwen Stacey), but Franco's performance is what stood out to me.ï»¿"
1229,You do know that spiderman did have the cops after him when he first started and they started to trust him more and more over time...so this movie is wrong with that partï»¿
1230,"this trailer was awesome, but the movie sucks!ï»¿"
1231,y is there a black one and a normal one?ï»¿
1232,"This spider man suit looked so much better than the new one.and this spider man was a HERO, thats how its supposed to be! the new one wasnt a hero, he was a criminal, he had cops looking for him? I enjoyed both of the movies. but this one will always be the true spider man.ï»¿"
1233,they shouldve just left venom out of this and set him up for SM4ï»¿
1234,"Like this video if you miss watching this movie 5 years old, like me :(ï»¿"
1235,1:31GODZILLA!!!!ï»¿
1236,my favorite movie in the trilogy . screw the haters . ï»¿
1237,I meant that It's not a terrible movie but it messed the trilogy up.ï»¿
1238,"....uh...dude, I think you need to re-read and fix ur comment. (Not trying to berate you or anything) You  totally contradicted urself.  First you said that Spider-man 3 wasn't the most disappointing movie of all time, then said it was a great movie, and then you said it fucked up the trilogy...ï»¿"
1239,"How to make this movie Better:1. Leave out the Sandman2. Leave out Gwen Stacy3. Dump the jazz muic4. give Venom more screen timeThe ONLY salvation to this movie was James Franco's performance, and even then it was still a bitch to put up with because he lost his memories throughout a good chunk of the movie.ï»¿"
1240,"Let me ask you something:If The third movie left out the Sandman, the Jazz music, and Gwen Stacey entirely and gave Venom more screen time, would you have liked the third movie better?ï»¿"
1241,you suck assï»¿
1242,spiderman 1-goodspiderman 2-very good spiderman 3-@#$#*the amazing spiderman- amazingï»¿
1243,YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE!!!!!ï»¿
1244,This could be the end of Spiderman... well It was... at least for Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire.ï»¿
1245,wow. r u sixï»¿
1246,Not of all time. It was a great movie but since spider-man 2 was soo good but 3 fucked up the trilogy.ï»¿
1247,This was the most disappointing movie of all time.ï»¿
1248,"i hated 2, i actually liked 3 the most, exept when harry diedï»¿"
1249,"its the last 30-40 seconds of ""Trinity"" i forget the person who makes it just look up trinity on youtubeï»¿"
1250,"as invader zim would say ""no u lie u lieeee!""ï»¿"
1251,What's the music at the very end???ï»¿
1252,"After all, I like this movie :Dï»¿"
1253,"Let's make this clear. This is the worst Spiderman movie, not a bad movie at all, but clearly the 2 first AND The amazing Spiderman movie are better.ï»¿"
1254,"i'm not agreeing, you think it sucks and i don'tï»¿"
1255,ohhhh so your saying that this type of spiderman is better. Thank you for agreeing with meï»¿
1256,Tobey should be in the new avengers movie!!!ï»¿
1257,i have 1-159ï»¿
1258,esto era mi infancia:)ï»¿
1259,"it doesn't suck, it's better than spider-man 3 but not better than the first 2ï»¿"
1260,I grew up with ram is spidey but TAS is betterï»¿
1261,you suck even moreï»¿
1262,you suckï»¿
1263,I will very much miss this type of spiderman. The Amazing spiderman sucksï»¿
1264,Ive Seen this movie like 16 times already but still I Love It!ï»¿
1265,really wow that would be cool.ï»¿
1266,... And I thought my acting was bad!ï»¿
1267,carnage wouldnt work they killed Venom and a big part in the comics would not happen Carnage v.s. Venomï»¿
1268,"All I can say about this Movie, is that I've seen worse Super-Hero Movies (and Movies in general), an O'k Movie.ï»¿"
1269,the amazing spider-man kicked ass but this movie is still okayï»¿
1270,This movie made me miss Green Goblin so much.ï»¿

1292,"What do you expect from a reboot......  ex.Batman parents got killed.....(Year later) in Batman Begins his parent got killed. Spider-man's uncle ben died.....(Years later) in the Amazing Spider-man his uncle died. Really, your complaining because its the same.ï»¿"
1293,and why?ï»¿

1324,AGREE !!!!!! Tobey FOREVER !!!ï»¿
1325,It was very Emotional at the end when Harry died.ï»¿
1326,Spider-Man 3 is the worst superhero movie ever.ï»¿
1327,"I would change a few things in the movie, Harry wouldn't die neither Venom. But I don't know why people hated it so much :Sï»¿"
1328,"The best trailer I've ever seen, yet the most disappointing movie ever.ï»¿"
1329,*mostï»¿
1330,i loved this one the bestï»¿
1331,1st one. good.2nd one. great3rd one. just awful and hadn't watched 1 and 2 for years cause of this mess.ï»¿
1332,i love this film but i was a bit disappointed with how eddie brock/venom was done. the bloke who played him is too skinny!!ï»¿
1333,fart...ï»¿
1334,Me neither.Not sure....ï»¿
1335,Not sure if retarded or trolling...ï»¿
1336,So?ï»¿
1337, It stands for computer generated images.ï»¿
1338,"Nope, it was awesome. I dont think you've seen new one.ï»¿"
1339,"Tobey Maguire is the best , Amazing spiderman sucksï»¿"
1340,What is CGI?ï»¿
1341,"Everybody relax, andrew garfield and tobey maguire are equally awesome and amazing so CALM THE FUCK DOWNï»¿"
1342,Really?ï»¿
1343,"Yes, if you didn't know Andrew did about 90% of the swinging and stunts unlike Tobey where he didnt do any at all.ï»¿"
1344,so you're saying the new spiderman is real?ï»¿
1345,Funny because Spiderman in Raimis trilogy was all CGI.ï»¿
1346,yupï»¿
1347,me tooï»¿
1348,HA you`re soo funny amazing spider man SUCKS this guy has muscles and absï»¿
1349,LOl meï»¿
1350,1:30 ... GODZIILLLLAAAAAA!!!!ï»¿
1351,yea!! i am!!!!! rofl ï»¿
1352,300%ï»¿
1353,awesome movieï»¿
1354,"well ik shooting web out of your hand is dumb, but look at it this way; don't have to waste your money on web fluid ï»¿"
1355,i actually like tobey better than andrew garfields.  i wish there was a spider man 4......ï»¿
1356,sameï»¿
1357,i know..........   i am SO PISSED OFFFï»¿
1358,"I don't think this trailer was well edited.  It failed to demonstrate that the movie is worth watching, even though it is.ï»¿"
1359,either way. they're not against each other everyone should stop comparing themï»¿
1360,"why does everyone compare Spider-Man to TASM thats all i hear not no ""oh friends with benifits is worster than TASM"" or ""The Wizard of Oz has more SUSPENSE than TASM"" just these two. WHY. Sam Raimi sounds nothing like Mark Webb. Tobey sounds nothing like Andrew. They're different Spider-Man Comic series. switching so many things around. two different Hero's.ï»¿"
1361,Yea I hated that in the movie she wasn't sexy or anything she was just a chick who got captured 3 times to many lolï»¿
1362,"The only reason why I like the amazing spiderman more than these 3 is because I hated Mary Jane... She was such a weak little girly girl... Although most female characters are. Every time something heavy is a bout to fall on her, she just freezes and expects Peter to save her -.-ï»¿"
1363,"I liked this film alot, sure not alot of stuff makes sense if your not familiar with the villains, but still an awesome movie, my only complaint was MJ, she was such a bitch throughout the entire thing....ï»¿"
1364,not original from youï»¿
1365,"Tobey was great, but I think I prefer Andrew.ï»¿"
1366,"yes,yes it doesï»¿"
1367,i no rightï»¿
1368,i know rightï»¿
1369,it was pretty coolï»¿
1370,Nope.ï»¿
1371,Kirsten Dunst singing in this movie made my ears bleed.ï»¿
1372,i actually think toby maguire was a much better spiderman than andrew garfield but i did see the amazing spiderman movie it was pretty awesome but i really loved toby maguire as spidermanï»¿
1373,hey i was bor n april 19ï»¿
1374,Oh please. You couldn't find your own weiner if somebody taped your belly up to your nipples.ï»¿
1375,It's was ok but venom was the big part in the movie and they messed up his image how hard is it to make a big venom like the tv seires and comics?ï»¿
1376,"Oic. Agreed with that but overall, Its doesn't look bad. I really enjoyed when I'm watching. just think its from other universe, i mean dont compare with comic. It will be perfect :)ï»¿"
1377,"Venom skinny like really lol, and the movie was really boring alot of talking and venom comes out in the end of the movie and his fight with spiderman sucked.ï»¿"
1378,so what is this app aboutï»¿
1379,I always wonder in which point?ï»¿
1380,"I like the original trilogy more but I dont think the new one is terrible. It looks fine but it just the ""back story""(not the movie plot) is dissapointing....and the suit XDï»¿"
1381,"Well. Both Garfield and Tobey have baby-face actually. I dont think its for us to say whether a person suit in a character or not. Everyone can be spider-man. Its just whether you accept or not (If you know what I meant). And they have different plot. Maybe you like the new plot but doesnt mean its better. If you think deeply and really really get the main theme what sam raimi trying to tell in the trilogy. I think there is no ""which one is better"". They both have Amazing Story.ï»¿"
1382,You are rightï»¿
1383,I love the amazing spiderman :)ï»¿
1384,"i saw the amazing spiderman and i thought it was terrible, the actor was awful  and the lizard looked really bad! i imagined it much cooler.... the older spiderman movies were much better and bad guys were way cooler, especially venom and doctor octopus. i thought that spiderman 3 and 2 were equally as awesome.... thumbs up if u feel the same wayï»¿"
1385,I grew up with the Spiderman videogames and movies. I love them all equally the same.ï»¿
1386,"The problem is people always prefer past over present, but infact does Mcguire even look like a legit tough guy spiderman? he has a baby-face, Garfield doesnt look like a tough guy but he doesnt have a babyface.The whole plot for the amazing spiderman is much better than the original movies, its more accurate to the comics and ratings are much higherï»¿"
1387,Spiderman 3 was very disappointing. ï»¿
1388,Agreed. The haters just simply give some excuses without any evidence. Reason is just because they hate it?!.....What a ridiculous comment I ever seen.ï»¿
1389,the concept of a guy killing uncle ben in first movie is from comic. They just make something different in spiderman 3. At least they are creative. So I think its better.ï»¿
1390,"The reviews and ratings DO NOT evaluate a movies. They are all depends on audience taste/favourite. The actors aren't better, they potrayed spiderman in their own style, the problem is just whether you accept or not. More accurate to the comic is the worst excuse for rating a movie.ï»¿"
1391,Better than 2? Hell no. More accurate to the comics? You must be blindï»¿
1392,LOOOOLï»¿
1393,"Hey, found you again!ï»¿"
1394,yesï»¿
1395,noï»¿
1396,"Don't listen to ignorant ppl, they just say it just so they can say it. Now i can understand what flaws this movie had: Venom having less screentime and not on steriods, not showing more scenes with New Goblin, Peter goes emo, Mj gets captured again. Other than that, i thought the movie was good. So yeah, haters will be haters because they can't do shit for themselves. Like what you wanna like man :)ï»¿"
1397,Epic fail movie in related vidï»¿
1398,I want Andrew Garfield to go up against carnage.ï»¿
1399,please tell meï»¿
1400,what say M.J because i don`t understand nothingï»¿
1401,Peter: I'm going to ask marry Jane to marry me. Aunt may: oh that reminds me of a boring story that will only make you feel guiltyï»¿
1402,This is what I think: I love both spider mans and I love Toby and Andrew and I love each and every movie but I'm not gonna not change that I was always a fan of Tobyï»¿
1403,"I went to see the new amazing spiderman... waste of money. Super lame, shitty, teenager movie. Not that this trilogy is a masterpiece, but its much, much betterï»¿"
1404,2 was the best oneï»¿
1405,@LarsonGrigsby They were both goodï»¿
1406,"@superrmrcool Nah dude, Spiderman 2 was the best oneï»¿"
1407,i think that Andrew Garfield was much better than Tobey Maguire.ï»¿
1408,"It looks like a triple feature, but the movie was only 2 hours long. Everyone should've known it would be a cluster fuck just from the trailer.ï»¿"
1409,yeah the game was pretty fun tooï»¿
1410,when? :S ï»¿
1411,no I don't see what was really wrong with the film I enjoyed it i personally think it was the best out of all three please do tell me what was wrong with the film seen as you have a taste in movies oh and a brain?ï»¿
1412,Whats the name og the songï»¿
1413,after seeing the amazing spider man i bought the old spiderman trilogy in blu rayï»¿
1414,1. Spiderman 12. Every other Spiderman movie because the rest were not near as goodï»¿
1415,Did anyone notice that Green Goblin can be seen in the bar during Peter and Gwen's date?ï»¿
1416,"Spider-Man 3 was a fair movie. It deserves to be better than it is but besides the cool shit, it just sucked lots of ass.ï»¿"
1417,I agree with you.ï»¿
1418,1. The Amazing Spider-Man2. Spider-Man 23. Spider-Man4. Spider-Man 3I liked Spider-Man 3 as much as Spider-Man but they're both fair. Spider-Man 2 was WAY better than Spider-Man 3.ï»¿
1419,way spiderman youre not in the avengersï»¿
1420,but why though? tobey was excellent playing spider man. ï»¿
1421,The Amazing Spider-Man >  Spider-Man 2 > Spider-Man > Spider-Man 3ï»¿
1422,"I have an upcoming fanfiction, which is really my own version of Spider-Man 3, which has New Goblin, Sandman, AND Rhino! Venom is hinted at the end and he will come out in a new fanfic called Spider-Man 4: Last Duel. My pen-name is Shadow-Factor and i've written three stories about GTA and Spidey over here! ï»¿"
1423,For me number from 1-4 favorites to least favorites I would say:1. The Amazing Spiderman2. Spiderman3. Spiderman 34 Spiderman 2ï»¿
1424,Hm i want Spiderman 4 with Tobey than that new amazing shit!ï»¿
1425,So much adrenaline watching the movies over again there all to good ï»¿

1435,no adrew garfield is better!!!ï»¿
1436,Bram Debrouwere fuck you it took me 6 years to track you downï»¿
1437,"You seriously don't get why people hated it? My friend, all you need is a taste in movies and a brain.ï»¿"
1438,good trilogy but the new spiderman is better.Although maguire is a good spidewrmanï»¿
1439,mhmmï»¿
1440,"OH MAN WTFUCK ! THE SCENE AT 1:47 WHEN HE LOOKS AT HIS REFLECTION THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN EPIC, BUT IN THE FINAL MOVIE THE REFLECTION WAS THE BLACK SPIDEY :P FUCK RAIMI.ï»¿"
1441,I have to somewhat agreeï»¿
1442,yh lolï»¿
1443,Really??? i dont get why people hated this movie i think it was best one :Sï»¿

1458,i dont see what people all of a sudden started to hate spiderman trilogy...i got to admit it was awesome back in the day...tobey did great job in roll of spider man...the amazing spiderman was great too...why do love one spidey and hate the other...i liked both movies...just sayin'...ï»¿
1459,Why are you retards hating on the amazing spiderman have you even seen it before you started hating on it? Also you do know that this series was based on the ultimate spider man comics when means that in spider man 4 they would have to replace Toby maguire since Peter Parker dies in the ultimate spider man comicsï»¿
1460,"These are the real spiderman movies none of that new shit ""the amazing spiderman"" fuck that its only been 5 years after the last one and they cant waiiit to milk in more money of the same goddamn movies. Besides the actors in this were amazing no one can even compare in other new spidey movies, tobey maguire, kirsten dunst , james franco <3 alwaaysï»¿"
1461,This is my favorite movie it's bad ass quit hating more venom would of been ok but Spider Man 4 would've been bad ass but they have to make that shit the amazing spider manï»¿
1462,The trailer was better then the movie. Hopefully we will see more of Venom and black spiderman in the new series.ï»¿
1463,I hate the fact that everyone thinks the rest of the original trilogy was bad all because of this movie.  Tobey did a great job!ï»¿
1464,@georgiesmason not originalï»¿
1465,"Why does everyone say this movie sucked? If its because of emo Spider-Man, then that's because of the suit.ï»¿"
1466,"special effects and action sequences don't make up for disco dancing, emo haircuts, and that 70's show villains. Sorry, bad movie.ï»¿"
1467,anyone else re-watching all the old spidermans after seeing the new one?ï»¿
1468,"I seriously hate how people were like ""Tobey wasnt bad"" last time and now after the new one they are like ""Tobey sucks"" and shit like that... ï»¿"
1469,"""This could be the end of Spiderman.""Awkward.ï»¿"
1470,It left me hangingï»¿
1471,"""Aw this movie will be awesome!""And then...""THAT'S NOT VENOM!!!""ï»¿"
1472,"This is my first ever youtube video, and I'm watching it 5 year later. Youtube was awesomeï»¿"
1473,Whats the song that starts at 1:23ï»¿
1474,Tobeywill be the worlds best spidermanï»¿
1475,No way!ï»¿
1476,Tobey was incredible as Peter Parker/spiderman.ï»¿
1477,spiderman 3 > the amazing spidermanï»¿
1478,"I will always love the first 3 more, but the Amazing Spiderman was pretty cool!ï»¿"
1479,IKR the black spiderman was so strong ï»¿
1480,this trailer looks amazing then the movie was the worst one out of the trilogy... good bad guys but venom aint no punk ass pussy from the daily bugal that gets fired and hates peter its the fucking jock from school. let down.ï»¿
1481,Man amazing spiderman is not stronger then black.ï»¿
1482,This could be the end of Spider-man ï»¿
1483,I liked this trilogyï»¿
1484,new one was betterï»¿
1485,yer i am lol. new one sucksï»¿
1486,that's what i did tooï»¿
1487,"I couldn't help myslef from watching this trailer now that I've seen the new film with Andrew Garfield. Although I love this trilogy, the Amazing SpiderMan managed to setup a really good base storyline to build off from so I am excited to see what they can do with the upcoming films with this new reboot.Perhaps the last film in this franchise could have been recieved with more praise if there weren't so many lose ends and twisting storylines. I do miss Tobey Maguire as Spidey though lol.ï»¿"
1488,omg yesï»¿
1489,Yeah there will be. There was an end scene after the ending title sequence.ï»¿
1490,It was a good start if their planning on a sequel i guess.. Andrew Garfield was really good in the role though..ï»¿
1491,lolï»¿
1492,I like the amazing spider man better than all three movies with tobey and kirsten but with tobey they were really good movies but that's just my opinionï»¿
1493,If Raimi had stated that this was gonna be his last movie then this movie would have been good. Because it rushed the villians and characters.ï»¿
1494,"Fuck the haters, this Spiderman trilogy is so much fucking better then this new one.  I have never really walked out of a cinema being disappointed but I was after seeing the new filmï»¿"
1495,911 people like this :Dï»¿
1496,"Its not this movie bad. Its just you dislike it. Please be fair to everyone. Sometimes, you might need to differentiate opinion and ""fact"". The fact is, This movie is Excellant. It contain memorable quote, Awesome effects, Cool acting, Perfect action. Maybe the story isn't that good. But it depends on audience taste.ï»¿"
1497,Wowï»¿
1498,"I dont understand why people dont like this movie. Honestly, in my opinion it was great. Great story, great effects, great villians. I loved it.ï»¿"

1501,"movie was good and a little boring but its not like the comics, :( + :3ï»¿"
1502,The Amazing Spiderman was better than the other Spiderman movies. A must watch!ï»¿

1507,Anybody else rewatching all the spiderman trailers after watching the new trailer.ï»¿
1508,Honestly i don't think they should've gave up on this version of spiderman i understand that this movie wasn't all that great but i still loved it but they should've went for the fourth movie and if that didnt turn out good than i would understand the rebootï»¿
1509,But still better then Twilight...ï»¿
1510,"It's not a fact, it's an opinion. Sure the screenplay was bad, but the special effects and action sequences were awesome and cool as well the dramatic effect it produced. I give it a 7.0 out of 10. Not good as the first two, but isn't bad neither.ï»¿"
1511,"""Facts""??? LOLï»¿"
1512,"#2 was the best for me. Then the Amazing , then Spider 1 then last was 3 which had too much drama and boring scenes. Toby still the better ï»¿"

1520,"Dude, you need to face facts sometimes, this movie was pretty bad mainly due to the studio pushing so much into the film.ï»¿"
1521,"i will have to agree, its classic, my favorite line from the fight is when Harry says ""I protected you in high school, know I'm gonna kick your little A**"", and then peter goes ""oohh"", lolï»¿"
1522,Dammit Sam Raimi! Why is this trailer so mich better than the movie?!!ï»¿
1523,fuck youï»¿

1535,the blu ray picture quality is fuckin amazing!!!! right up there with the dark knight blu ray. even the spiderman 3 blu ray that came with a ps3 bundle looks and sounds unbelievable!!ï»¿
1536,i love all the movies for one reason: IT'S FUCKING SPIDERMAN!!!! IN LIVE ACTION MOVIES!!!! HOLY SHIT!!!!ï»¿
1537,"two different people. sandman killed uncle ben, apparentley. they were using revenge as a plot device, and they needed a reason for spidey to hate sandman.ï»¿"
1538,I'm so confused!? So the person in Spiderman 1 who killed his uncle wasn't actually the one who killed his uncle? Sandman IS that criminal in number 1 who killed his Uncle?orThey're two different people and Sandman is the real person who killed his uncle?ï»¿
1539,I really enjoyed this movie and the premiere was on my birthday :)ï»¿
1540,This was my favourite out of the 3ï»¿
1541,"Even though the Amazing Spiderman looks like its gonna be better than this series of movies im still disappointed at the cancelation of Spiderman 4, i was really hoping at the possibility of seeing Carnage..ï»¿"
1542,i feel you ..ï»¿
1543,This was epic in 2007ï»¿
1544,yeah that was ridiculous ï»¿
1545,Spiderman 3 is best described as a Mexican soap opera with mind-blowing special effects.ï»¿

1557,I know rightï»¿
1558,My bad sorry.I don't why I KEEP ON MISTAKING THEM.ï»¿
1559,Many Reasons1.Emma Watson singing.2.Peter not able to sense New Goblin before being attacked by him.3.Too much crying.4.Shit casting for venom.5.Venom in it.(Because he was forced into the story).6.Emo Peter Parker.7.Emo Peter Parker acting like a faggot and a douchebag.8.So depressing. ï»¿

1568,"looks like the 40 people who dislikes this video was stopped by SPIDER-MAN and send them to prison from doing something bad,and the other 40 people who dislikes this video was beat down by VENOM from saying so much shit...!!!!!!!ï»¿"
1569,This trailer is so epicï»¿
1570,Emo Spiderman is what ruined this movieï»¿
1571,Spider Man 3 is like one of my favorite movies! I don't see why most people think it's awful.ï»¿
1572,2:09 this could be the end of spiderman... me: you're right because they will reboot it haha lol! XDï»¿
1573,and peter doesn't even find the answer to where he got the suit!ï»¿
1574,The Amazing Spiderman looks epic.Andrew Garfield is a badassï»¿
1575,"Okay everyone who hates this movie listen up. Everyone agrees that emo Peter and the dancing scene was pointless, stupid and awful. BUT the rest of the movie was good and I believe you think so too. So stop being so desperate to try to get attention by joining the ""bash Sam Raimi Spiderman club."" Amazing spiderman could be good, could be bad, we don't know so please. Stop saying it's better than this movie before you've even seen it!ï»¿"
1576,Your mum blowssss.ï»¿
1577,The amazing spiderman blowssssï»¿
1578,"Fuck the amazing spider man movie, the original is the best. Remove yourself if you think different.ï»¿"
1579,@LordMalice6d9 agreed that was one of the weaknesses of the film in hindsight though it was never as terrible as people said it was at firstï»¿
1580,"Just saw this again for the first time since it came out -- not perfect, but minus the hype, the overcrowded theatre with broken AC and annoyingly noisy kids, it's a HELL of a lot more enjoyable! Worth a second chance, people!ï»¿"
1581,amazing spiderman is not that great... ï»¿
1582,Exactly 5 years later The Avengers is Released.ï»¿
1583,XP on the new suit. Now I wanna see the movie!!!!! But where's venom?ï»¿
1584,The new suit looks crap..ï»¿
1585,1:31 oh no  its a humanoid sand godzilla run we have no chanceï»¿
1586,And venom ?????????? O.oï»¿
1587,going around shaking his pelvis around and puting his hair over his eye isn't my idea of evilï»¿
1588,Idk personally I liked the idea of an evil Peter Parker personally..ï»¿
1589,Topher Grace was an awesome Venomï»¿
1590,"you have VENOM, one of the most coolest villians in marvel history, and the choice is Topher Grace!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! thats like having Justin Bieber play WOLVERINE!!!!!!!!!! The worst move in Superhero film history!!!!!!!ï»¿"
1591,"I 100% agree, Topher Grace sucked as Venom!!!!!!!!!!!!!! he should have gotten a razzie award lolzï»¿"
1592,"i DON'T THINK SPIDERMAN 3 WAS AS BAD AS PEOPLE SAY IT IS, THE ONLY THINGS WERE TOO MANY BAD GUYS AND HOW VENOM IS SKINNY AND HE IS HUGE IN THE COMICS, AND TOPHER GRACE SUCKED AS VENOM, HE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN A RAZZIE AWARD, HOWEVER TOBEY MAGUIRE AND JAMES FRANCO DID A GREAT JOB THOUGHï»¿"
1593,It was way too different from the first two.and emo peter parker really ruined the movieï»¿
1594,"So you have Venom, one of the most bad ass characters in comics history and your choice to portray him is....Topher Grace? No wonder they had to reboot the franchiseï»¿"
1595,Shit excuse for a spiderman movie? That could not be more wrong. This movie was a classic along with the first and second.ï»¿
1596,"They were probably gonna save Conners and the Lizard for a later spiderman film like maybe Spiderman 4, but we all know SM4 never happened. For shame.ï»¿"
1597,They should have saved venom for the 4th movie. Throwing him in at the last minute in the third movie was a bad idea.ï»¿
1598,"what would've added just a little bit more thrill to the trailer, would be after the ""3"" was shown having the scene when Brock first turns into Venom and he swallows the camera.ï»¿"
1599,only in tha ULTIMATE universeï»¿
1600,It hasn't come out yet.don't make up your mind until july 3rd.(I think thats when its coming out anyway)ï»¿
1601,"yes, spider man dies ,and is replaced by miles morales,but that's in the ultimate universe!!!ï»¿"
1602,will smith lolï»¿
1603,lolï»¿
1604,What a shit excuse for a Spiderman movie.Can't wait till the Amazing Spidermanï»¿
1605,Ok. if you say itï»¿
1606,Perfect!! I really wanted to see what sam rami's version of the lizard was gonna look like. But now since there not making a 4th we'll never know :(ï»¿
1607,"Even though there PROBALLY not making a spiderman 4 and they'll PROBALLY just start of new with the amazing spiderman series i would still want to see how they would continue with this version, how dr connor's would have looked like as the lizard, if they would have continued with the symbiote thing and possibly create carnage etc. I know alot of people hate this version of spiderman but theres ALOT of people that like it, and just to see my childhood come back just 1 more time would be great!!!ï»¿"
1608,they didn't really screw up gwen inso far as she didn't even really have a character beyond peter using her to stir the shit between him and MJ. besides they screwed her up as far back as spiderman 1 since he was in love with MJ first. I mean i understand why they did that but stillï»¿
1609,spoiler perter parker dies and is replaced by some black guyï»¿
1610,This movie single handedly caused the end to the best US sitcom.....That 70s Show....Thanks spiderman >:(ï»¿

1620,"This trilogy was good but the amazing spiderman might be better.... they should keep making sequels to it to amazing spiderman 4 or 5. They should use villains like vulture and kraven would go good in a movie together, black spiderman and venom would be good to return but venom should be bigger this timeï»¿"
1621,Venom is probably the most wasted villain in a movie since Darth Maul from Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. :(ï»¿
1622,Trailer is better than the movieï»¿
1623,ideas for Amazing spiderman. Venom should come back not goblin been in every movie already and if black spider does not return will get mad.iï»¿
1624,"@NewcastleEmperor ikr. i was like 6 years old when i started growing up with shitty sam raimi's film. i was a kid back there so i loved the movie and believed all the story they made up from the three. sam raimi's film mislead most of us kids back there and now look, most of us like the gay tobey as spiderman.ï»¿"
1625,I'm glad to be an idiot i enjoyed those 3 movies ï»¿
1626,shut up haters.This is for sure one of the best movies ever. FACT!ï»¿
1627,Spider-man was with avengersï»¿
1628,"You know that alien glue peter gave to dr curt? That thing will escape and manage to go in that capsule that made harry and his father stronger, it will transform it into carnage, but anyhow, this thing is still going to become carnage, and the lizard will become I like that after the dr tries to regenerate his arm, he will use lizard cells to make it work i think, once he transforms into the lizard, he will turn out crazy and brake everything up, making the alien glue   escape.ï»¿"

1631,spiderman is an avenger anywayï»¿

1633,"Um have you seen the Prometheus trailer and snow white and the huntsman, also the dark night rises. AANd even the newest trailer of spiderman... seriouslyï»¿"
1634,the venom thing was Sony's fault not Sam Rami. Sam wanted Venom in 4 and only to cameo in 3.ï»¿
1635,Venom is probably the most wasted villain in a movie since Boba Fett and Darth Maul from the Star Wars movies.ï»¿
1636,"Yeah, and also they screwed up Mary Jane because she was just a whiny little bitch throughout the movie.ï»¿"
1637,"I just hate the fact that they cancelled spiderman 4, there was going to be carnage and the lizard.ï»¿"
1638,i know and it looks a thousand times better...! :Dï»¿
1639,haha ru kidding? have you seen the trailer for the new one?ï»¿
1640,"""This could be the end of Spider-Man"" I guess he wasn't kidding. ï»¿"
1641,Rofl they shown every detail about film but not venom. way to ruin film by trailer.ï»¿
1642,The Rami films were the best. Harry ROCKS and screw the rebootï»¿
1643,daym the new amazing spiderman will never be this good!! 4th best movie ever!ï»¿
1644,"They left out that terrible dance moment and emo Peter, no wonder i brought the movie.ï»¿"
1645,This isnt a that bad movie. Sure worst than the first 2 but not bad.ï»¿
1646,"Spiderman will always be a part of us!!! Peter parker has made me understand that there is a Hero within all of us!!! Whatever life has in store for me....i will always remember these words...

1647,"HAPPY 5 YEAR ANNIVERSIRY SPIDERMAN 3,JUST TODAY 5 YEARS AGO YOU CAME TO THEATHERS,PLEASE LIKE THIS COMMENTï»¿"
1648,The trailer should have included a caption saying 'PREPARE FOR DISAPPOINTMENT'.Or the brilliant collection of stories that they were trying to tell should have been split into a two part film. Shame.ï»¿
1649,"screw you haters i love sam raimi's trilogy, sm 3 was awesome, i do admit it had its flaws but it was still awesome.i wanted a spider-man 4 but the reboot looks epic, and im hoping they do it justice!ï»¿"
1650,"I'm sorry, but you can't like this movie and call yourself a spiderman fanï»¿"
1651,What I hate most about this movie was the fact that they screwed up Gwen Stacy's character! And they killed off Venom only 15 minutes after he appeared on screen! He's suppose to be bad-ass!ï»¿
1652,"Uh, you do know that they've reboot the series, right?ï»¿"
1653,The only thing I disliked was the fact this movie was so predictable and not enough Venom screen time :(.ï»¿
1654,spiderman 3 should be rebootsï»¿
1655,"I still don't get the hate. Sure it had it's problems but people act like it was the new Batman and Robin.Honestly, I'd take this anyday over The Dark Knight. ï»¿"
1656,"No Dude,You're right..f**k them whoever shit about the movie..SP3 is obviously best in the series..ï»¿"

1658,"6 days from today will be the 5 year aniversiry since this movie came out cant believe it has been all that long i rememver watching it and how exsited i was to see it,who agreesï»¿"
1659,james francooooï»¿
1660,Call be crazy but I thought this film was the best of the trilogyï»¿
1661,"i know right! its like ppl is exaggerating the few mistakes of the movie, i bet you that all those haters probably loved they movie and they were happy when they got out of the theater but is like they don't have a personal opinion, and the media at that time was atacking really strong and saying it was a bad movie, so all stupid ppl start to think the sameï»¿"
1662,finally a smart guy! i agree with you those fucking haters love andrew thats the real reason they love the reboot and cause they think they are comicbook fans! the trilogy was AMAZING and they criticize the movies with invalid arguments! im glad you know this trilogy is the real spidermanï»¿
1663,"it wasn't like that! sam raimi had sandman as the main villian and the new goblin for make harry finally gets his revenge. then sony wanted to please the fans(nerds) so they pushed sam raimi against his own will to add venom into the plot, and that was what runinned the movie cause it was too much, venom was suppoused to appear in Spiderman 4 with alot more explanation about its originsï»¿"
1664,"Venom got so little screen time, cause they wanted to make only a trilogy so they decided to put everyones favorite Spiderman villian in it. They also needed to explain his origins with black Spiderman, and they had to conclude the plot about Harry's vengance, AND during all this they needed more action so the audience wouldn't get bored so they added sandman, but what about MJ? Then they forgot about Gwen Stacy from the comics so they added her so the nerds wouldn't get mad. It was well done.ï»¿"
1665,"I didn't see many trailers for this movie and I didn't know what to expect really, so I thought Venom was awesome!ï»¿"
1666,"I love this movie, I still don't see what all the fuss is about.ï»¿"
1667,Batman is DC and Spiderman is Marvel.ï»¿
1668,"horrible piece of shit, no were near as moving or as cool as the second one.ï»¿"
1669,Black spiderman ownage harry :Dï»¿
1670,Good point.ï»¿
1671,Venom wasn't even in this trailer what a fail.ï»¿
1672,Always watch the end of this trailer with volume on high. Sooooo fucking awesome.ï»¿
1673,"True but the main reason Batman got a reboot was the fact that last two movies were bad, with B&R being horrible enough to kill any more interest in the franchise as it was.Spider-Man had an origin story already.ï»¿"
1674,"...Yes because Saturday Night Live Parker is the the Spider-Man I know and love from the comics. And yes I can say that. I dont give a crap about that queer voiced Tobey Faguire, he wasn't Spidey in my eyes at all. As I say, TASM for the win. Given the trailer is pretty epic, the movie was bad.ï»¿"
1675,"For those of you complaining about ""The Amazing Spiderman movie"", REALITY CHECK peoples.1. They are hundred of Reboot out there who are less than 10 years. Superhero reboot are nothing just look at Batman or the Hulk.2. Noone saying you have to go see the movie but I bet you going to see it anyway.3. Sam Rami quits (for reasons Im not aware) and they have to cancelled Spiderman 4 not because Spiderman 3 was bad it because everyone wants a new Spiderman movie.  ï»¿"
1676,when the trailer is better than the movie. smhï»¿
1677,because it will take 3 parts to cover 1 book of the series T-Tï»¿
1678,Good trailerBad movie =(ï»¿
1679,"You say that while watching this trailer!!! Evidently you can't have thought it was an ""Utter peice of shit"" as you say.Btw, working on ur spelling mate. peice is spelled as 'piece'.Oh and it was not ""horrible"" actually. It was actually pretty good, maybe not as good as Spiderman 2, but a decent effort considering that Sam Raimi was under enormous pressure from the studio to use Venom and the fact that he had no creative room during this whole thing. So cut the film slack.ï»¿"
1680,"This is what every trailer for this movie should have been like. If people didn't expect him, they may have thought this movie was awesome because he's their favorite villain.ï»¿"
1681,Spiderman 2 game??ï»¿
1682,"Oh no, doctor connors classI got so caught up in what I was doing I forgot all about itHe's gonna kill meï»¿"
1683,"Everybody shut up!!! It does not matter who is playing the roll,it is still spiderman! As long as Andrew garfield plays the part good(he will)there is nothing to complain about. And don't say that ""tobey is spiderman"" shit because your wrong. There are countless cartoons and comics of spiderman,these movies,and the new one. So there is no one spiderman. There are lot of spidermans and are all equal.ï»¿"
1684,@ILieICheatandISteal Actually Peter Parker is spiderman.ï»¿
1685,"it wasn't that terrible, but it was bad, i have to admit.ï»¿"
1686,HORRIBLE UTTER PEICE OF SHIT.BRING ON ASMï»¿
1687,Was this good i cant believe they wanna make a 4th it looks horrible but i just watch the 2nd one lol in late on my movies but was it good?ï»¿
1688,Dums up if you are still watching this trailer in 2012ï»¿
1689,ILielCheatandISteal I agree with you about the spiderman being Toby but I've got to disagree about Keaton being batman. I mean sure he was great and the movies were classic but the new batman is a different type of batman movie. It's not all fun and games but just more terrifying. Too dark that if Keaton or West could do it they would die of a heart attack from the insanity that is christopher Nolan.ï»¿
1690,"""This could be the end of Spider-Man"", how ironic, sadly it was. Now were getting a reboot, oh well can't wait to see it though!ï»¿"
1691, wat the fuk is stuck up harry's assï»¿
1692,fuk the sand manï»¿
1693,wouldn't be a reboot if they didn't. just another sequel ï»¿

1698,"blind bitch! succeful movies everybody loves them expect you and your bunch of ""real fans"" wich translation is ""haters"" those movies were great i read the comics, my friends read the comics and they loved the movies too, so careful using the ""real fans"" shit cause you can't speak for everybody else, your lack of attention tells me you are a kid that lies about reading the comics of you are and old ""simpleton"" like u said with a geek life and as you have nothing better to do you are bitching hereï»¿"
1699,"i really like spiderman 3, its just that venom and the fuckn sandman were such shitty villians they cacelled it, im gunna miss this spiderman so much:(...this isnt rightï»¿"
1700,"OMG! thanks for your comment! i think the exact same thing, when i saw the movie i was like yeah! it has the tone of spiderman, his personality, the funny elemnts, the dramma, and at the end all the dark stuff. I loved this fims cause they are cool and how an movie adaptations from comic should be! and i also think the new film is just a Dark knight wannabeï»¿"
1701,"Don't you get tired bitch! Stop being such a hater! terrible CGI? spiderman 2 won an oscar for best special effects! nobody hated those movies you are just and idiot and a kid, if you are such an adult why are you spaming all over youtube about spiderman? get a damn life! unless you are fan of ""days of summer"" i don't think you should trust that much in marc webb, the guy is a rookie! Sam is a legend! if the new movie is bad you will say ""it was cool"" u won't have the ball to admit u were wrongï»¿"
1702,"I have no problem with the Tobey Spiderman movies, i think all three are equally good (with 3 lacking a bit into story)but you know, if you kept up with the news for the supposed-to-be fourth spider movie, youâ€™d know that sam raimi was gonna put Vulture as the Enemy. Obviously when Venom was in the third movie, the majority of people expected Carnage soon, or at least a Villain who's equally as challenging. but Vulture? i would not bother watching that spiderman movie.ï»¿"
1703,Give me sone reasons why this movie was badï»¿
1704,Good times.. Good times :'[ ï»¿
1705,Same reason they're remaking Superman no reason just because they can't make anything else new. ï»¿
1706,I had such high hopes for this movie after the second one..-_-ï»¿
1707,Trailers are so deceiving. ï»¿
1708,Random guy. Their replacing him with the guy who helped make facebook lol. Andrew Garfieldï»¿
1709,"peter might be a genius but he doesn't have the resources to make the webb shooters so for me the biological webbs are better! adrew is anoying and i don't like him! the movie used the most important theme of the comics and that was being a hero! i hate those movies that are the exact same thing that its source material like ""the last airbender"" for me and adaptation has to take the soul of the source material and make it into a movie thats why i love spiderman! ï»¿"
1710,but the biological webbs are better!ï»¿
1711,@nonefour That's how it's supposed to be in the comics he makes web shooters not some neverending supply of web from his wristsï»¿
1712,"""This could be the end of Spider Man""ï»¿"
1713,only way a spiderman 4 was possible is if a few changes were made to spiderman 3. first off push the symbiote storyline to spiderman 4. replace the sandman with the lizard. have peter fight off harry and the lizard and when he defeats them (most likely killing them) feels like shit breaks up with mj and than we have our set up for the depression. spiderman 4 should have been the symbiote/venom movie.ï»¿
1714,Why Spiderman 3 sucked.1.Emma Watson Singing2.Emo Peter Parker3.No Spider sense before the new goblin flew down and grabbed him.4.Emma Watson singing5.Peter Dancing in cafeThe Amazing Spiderman all the wayï»¿
1715,Best Spiderman ever=Tobey Maguireï»¿
1716,even in the new spider man Peter makes a Device to shoot his web for him? wdf? This spider man was much betterï»¿
1717,They should had put what they were gonna do in ASM and use it as this films plot and save Venom for Spider-Man 4ï»¿
1718,"@fanficfanguy Right, Like you knew Tobey Maguire BEORE the Spider-man trilogyï»¿"
1719,why didn't they make a remake of Eragon instead of Spiderman? spiderman wasn't necessary....ï»¿
1720,Whats happen to you i dont know i became spiderman3.ï»¿
1721,he was right it is the end lolï»¿
1722,@oladeji123 yea spiderman 1 was the best :D the good days ï»¿
1723,@jjdutan I don't know which spiderman comics you read but  the closest tobey looked to peter parker was in spiderman 1ï»¿
1724,"@johnhyx23 The closest tobey looked to peter parker was in spiderman 1. But after that he just gained weight and didn't look like a geek; Does someone have to look like a nerd in order to know that that person is a nerd. Just because the new peter parker doesn't look like one, he will probably sound like one. Not every nerd wears glasses. Plus he may just have been trying to fit in which is why he trys looking like a cool kidï»¿"
1725,@oladeji123 i have read the comics and it look nothing like that dude to conclude this spiderman looks better my opinionï»¿
1726,@johnhyx23 go read the comics and tell me who looks more similar to peter parker form the comics. ï»¿
1727,@oladeji123 I think YOU need to shut up lol. You must not know what fat is because Tobey is far from being fat. And how does he not look like Peter Parker? He has the same hair color and looks like a nerd just like Peter Parker. The only thing Andrew Garfield has over Tobey in terms of looking like peter parker is eye color.ï»¿
1728,@jjdutan If you have ever read the comics then you would know that peter paker looked exactly like that. The suit is probably a wet suit. He's a smart kid not a billionaire. He cant make nice looking suitsï»¿
1729,@oladeji123 this new guy is wayyyyyyyyy TOO FUCKING  SKINNY AND WHATS WITH THE SUIT IT LOOKS WET AND HIS HAIR TOO PUFFYYYYYï»¿
1730,"The age of Spider man 4, is over. The Time of The Amazing Spiderman, has come!ï»¿"
1731,Every one saying that they miss tobey need to shut up. He sucked as spiderman. He was fat and he looked nothing like perter parker. This new guy is skinny and actually looks like Peter Parker from the comicsï»¿
1732,"...the director said he couldnt finish the rest of the series, so sony decided to just repeat the series with a new director, actors, everything...rather than just finding a new director. extemely stupid. why couldnt they find a new director? it was lyk that for harry potter & even twilight, & more franchises. its so simple, why do they have to start over?ï»¿"
1733,"wow...i just found out there was gonna be a spider-man 4, but the director & sony got in a fight & cancelled it. it was supposed to come out in 2011!! so instead they decided to reboot the entire series. kinda pisses me off...knowing that we couldve had a movie just last year...its really a shame._Ÿ˜”ï»¿"

1739,Mary Jane in Spider Man 3 = This isn't about you. It's about me.ï»¿
1740,I remember leaving the cinema soooooo disappointed after watching this film; especially after the brilliance of Spider-Man 2.ï»¿
1741,The way Spider-Man fans found this movie disappointing is similar to how X-Men fans were disappointed with X-Men: The Last Stand.ï»¿
1742,"Venom shouldn't even have been in the movie in the first place. The original story was way better, but unfortanetly Venom's popularity had to ruin everything.No wonder Sam Raimi left the franchise. He didn't get to use his ideas. Look i love Venom alot. I honestly think he was really good in Spider-Man 3. But he's not the holy grail of super-villains! ï»¿"
1743,"just because its a lot different from the bd's doesn't mean it's bad, i didn't saw the bd's before the movie and after i saw it and i prefer the movieï»¿"
1744,love this movie.ï»¿
1745,This is one of my favorite trailers of all time.ï»¿
1746,@tyler8222 I think it's a shame that just one fucking scene (the emo spider being a douchebag on the streets) could ruin an entire epic trilogy. These three classic movies are awesome.ï»¿
1747,zillaï»¿
1748,godzilla roar in 1:31ï»¿
1749,@tyler8222  It didnt go with the comics and venom and black suit were there for a little time when in the comics they were there for years.ï»¿
1750,I WAS ACTUALLY REALLY PISSED ABOUT THE NEW SPIDERMAN MOVIE COMING OUT WITH A HOLE DIFFERENT CAST THE ONLY GOODSIDE TO IT IS THAT LIZARD IZ GOIN TO BE IN ITï»¿
1751,I honestly thought it was a decent movie. the first 2 were better and the reboot is going to be better but it was still an average movie. I guess people didn't like it so much cause the trailers were fucking epicï»¿
1752,1:31 gozilla roar lmaoï»¿
1753,"It wasn't THAT bad, minus the sandman and it's pretty decent...ï»¿"
1754,"Cool movie, Sam. Needs more Venom and shit.ï»¿"
1755,"@loverboyz1393 So do I and I still love this movie just after watching the second one this was a bit of a let down but, you are completely right after watching it again the emotions are strong in the film and I've always thought that the end was powerful.ï»¿"
1756,"after watching The Amazing Spiderman's trailer... i think that it will be a lotttttt bbetter than Spiderman 1, 2 and 3!ï»¿"
1757,I neeed electro to fry spiderman. That the only villian spiderman can't defeat vemon has to help his ass defeat him.ï»¿
1758,@MrAlexMovieGuy I got to say the second or 3rd time I watch it I actually love the ending. The team work between spidey and the his friend was amazing.ï»¿
1759,WHO THE HELL USES A LENS HOOD AT NIGHT ï»¿
1760,ELEMENTARY NOSTALGIA :'D I remember seeing this trailer when I was in the 5th or 4th grade. :) guess I'll spend Valentine's Day watching this movie and some star wars *forever alone* ï»¿
1761,Still awesome but the weakest in the series too long and too many villainsï»¿
1762,"@Mordor6121512 Yeah, build up to Green Goblin. Putting him as the first villain wasn't that smart... And then killing him in the same movie was stupider... Doc Connors has a connection with Spidey. That's why they made him the villain. Because it's so difficult to fight somebody that you care about.ï»¿"
1763,@neopork100 1. Pause and mute this trailer2. Open another tab and type Amazing Spider-Man trailer 2.3. Close this tab.4. FEEL THE EPICNESS!!!!ï»¿
1764,"@Mordor6121512 might as well start off fresh and maybe we can build up to Green Goblin and what not, I think Electro or Mysterio would make awesome movie villains. ï»¿"
1765,"@jjboy157 The Lizard is a good villain, but he isn't as good as Green Goblin, Doc Ock, Venom or Carnage.. Those are real enemies of Spidey..ï»¿"
1766,Thumbs up if u came here after watching The Amazing Spiderman Trailerï»¿
1767,@neopork100 bitch ass Awsome!ï»¿
1768,@Mordor6121512 Subpar? The Lizard? He's almost EATEN Spidey before. In a comic from the 80's when the lizard evolves he bites off 2 of spideys fingers... They eventually grew back though.ï»¿
1769,@jjboy157 I'm really not looking forward to the reboot considering the main villain is someone subpar.. I'm guessing everybody is trying to imitate Christopher Nolan's style now beginning with the hero facing a subpar villain and then in the sequel he meets his greatest enemy ever..ï»¿
1770,"@Mordor6121512 Yeah, but Peter kind of was an annoying bitch in this movie series LOL.Glad they're rebooting it.ï»¿"
1771,"With this trailer, I did not expect crappy acting, thirty thousand villains, a gay Peter Parker that dances showtunes, and a mini-Venom.ï»¿"
1772,I've just come here to say goodbye.ï»¿
1773,this movie sucks so muchï»¿
1774,2:08 and wasï»¿
1775,"@jonnemesis11 Wait, so you're saying this movie is good only because it got a 60% in Rotten Tomatoes? Hell do you even know that Rotten Tomatoes gave Spidey 1 and 2 a 90% and 93% respectively? Don't get me wrong, Spidey 3 had the potential to outshine them both had they switched villains and focused more on Peter's life than on that annoying bitch.. She didn't even look as good as she did in the first movieï»¿"
1776,"@jonnemesis11 I don't hate it because everybody hates it, I hated it because they didn't do Venom any justice.. The mistake was putting Sandman as the main villain, and the writers tried to fit in too many plots and too many characters, making it too convoluted.. The first 2 were focused on Peter, while this tended to focus more on MJ than on Peter..ï»¿"
1777,"@Mordor6121512 not really you hate it cause everybody else hates it too, i have my own opinion and i liked the movie, it did had the mistake of having venom and killing harry but other than that this movie was good!ï»¿"
1778,@oss182 It was no way as bad as Batman & Robin. That movie almost killed the Batman franchise. It needed a reboot. The Spider-Man film franchise was fixable without the need of a reboot.ï»¿
1779,i HATE that harry died!!!he was my favorite character.....and he was hotï»¿
1780,"people who says this movie suck is stupid! first of all this movie had 60% in rotten tomatoes which is really high comparing it with every movie out there, the only thing this movie did wrong was not be good as the first too, but still was a good movie, when i saw it on the theater i liked alot! so if you think this movie sucks is just because somebody else says it, get your own opinion and stop letting you go by what ppl are saying!!! emo???? alot of ppl have that look and they are not emo!ï»¿"
1781,"@vintage72990 finally someone gets me lol i loved this 3 movies, that fucking reboot and yeah im agree it should be a flop for so they bring tobey backï»¿"
1782,@neopork100 Wow! It's right on cue too!ï»¿
1783,"yayyyyy TOBEYYYYY!!!!!!!! <3 my opinion: he should have still been spiderman in the next version, and no matter what anyone says you have to admit kirsten dunst makes a perfect mj, especially in the way she looks, they shuldnt have canceled the fourth and if they had to they shuldve ended it all together. ngl, i hope the next one flops.ï»¿"
1784, 1:30 Godzilla o_oï»¿
1785,"2 villain can work, look at dark knightï»¿"
1786,Massively dissappointing movie.. Raimi fucked up his interests.. He chose Sandman because he was just graphically interesting.. Venom was cast as a side villain where Sandman should have been cast as.. The acting in this movie was fucked up.. It focused more on Mary Jane's personal life rather than Peter's.. The only redeemable factor about this movie is its special effects.. Other than that this movie is one of those movies that truly defines the '3rd movie disease'ï»¿
1787,"@PhoenixLegand That's how most of Spider-man's villains are in the comic, what I found more repetitive was the fact that Mary Jane getting kidnapped happened in each film, that got really old.ï»¿"
1788,Biggest mistake I have ever made was seeing this film. I wanted to shoot myself. Fuck you Raimiï»¿
1789,Once again a man gets involved with some gone wrong science thing and then tries to kill spider man. Clap hands for the writers. They took one story and told it three times. But good movie.ï»¿

1791,Spider-Man is awesome! I saw this movie when I was 9 and was excited to see some black suit action...all I saw was emo Peter dancing like an idiot. Andrew Garfield is an interesting choice. Hope new movie is like the Ultimate Spidey comicsï»¿
1792,The marketing for this movie was damn good. ï»¿
1793,@neopork100  i prefer to listen to this  trailerï»¿
1794,"@Johnlindsey289 I strongly disagree with you. I loved all 3 movies & I was upset to find out they canceled the 4th movie. I am a true Spider-Man fan. I love the comics, but I think they shoulda stuck with these movies.ï»¿"
1795,This looks better than the amazing spidermanï»¿
1796,weather or not the movie wasnt that great this trailer was fucking awesome and still isï»¿
1797,oh and i forgot Topher Grace as Eddie Brock/Venom... have you all seen how he looks in the comics/animated series? HORRIBLE casting for one of Spideys top villiansï»¿
1798,This movie was a JOKE ! They screwed up the whole Venom Origin the best villian in the franchise... Venom is recovered in the animated 90s series after J.Johnah Jameson's son ( who's a pilot ) crashes after an unknown black goo attacks him in the shuddle. When spidey saves him he encounters the goo not thinking its anything but its the symbiot. Instead they turned the plot into a joke to jam villians together and make Peter Parker a dancing a**hole whos a jerk? wow... no wonder they didnt returnï»¿
1799,"This looks bad ass! Too bad this film didn't turn out like this at all... It was too goofy.I can think of a great opening: Kurt Connors is now The Lizard and Spider Man chases him through the city or whatever! There's an opening!! You know instead of making up new characters, how bout using someone you already have!ï»¿"
1800,"@Johnlindsey289 No, i just loved this spiderman trilogy BECAUSE of tobey,kristen dunst ectï»¿"
1801,mmmm james franko is  greatï»¿
1802,"@Johnlindsey289 Yeah but tobey, aunt may, kristen dunst ect they was all so perfect! I loved those movied, its hard to believe that its over! The new movie look like trashï»¿"
1803,"We have to forgive each other, or everything we ever were will mean nothing. ï»¿"

1805,i want this spider man character back and the suit i love him like no homo thubms this up plz i grew up with these movies please ï»¿
1806,this movie is unreal !!!!!ï»¿
1807,Im gonna miss Toby in the new Spiderman 4. :'(ï»¿
1808,"i wish they maked a spiderman 4. The Dr connors in this movies would have been perfect for the lizzard, and he still have a part og the symbiote(carnage or a new venom?). Vulture and black cat was going to be in the spider man 4. Carnage and lizzard was most likley to be in 5 and 6. They was going to make 4,5 and 6 at the same time. ï»¿"
1809,"@RhythmxxNation It was good, but they hyped up venom so much and ruined him!ï»¿"
1810,"This movie started out to be really good, i actually thought for a second that it was gonna be better then the 1st and 2nd one until the emo part with parker started, everything from that point until the end just went downhill. The main thing that got me mad was how they ruined venom, look up venom on youtube and watch any video of him except for the spiderman 3 ones, not one video is his voice high pitched like in the movie, and he's suppose to be ALOT buffer and more intimidating smhï»¿"
1811,Yeah the thirst for vengeance can turn almost any man into something he's not...but I'm not any man...I'm Nobody!ï»¿
1812,spider man is the best super hero movie iv'e ever watched! dark knight is boring!.. iron man is amazing.. but still spider is all time!(:ï»¿
1813,niceï»¿
1814,"@jonath198 And dont even support them by spending money to watch the reboot, just download it on piratebay, otherwise the lemon will never get enough pressured and theyll make more.ï»¿"
1815,"@jonath198 Seriously, we have to move on, 3 decades and a new century has come since the last Spider-Man comics, we aint need no more movies. I loved this trilogy, and that was the end if I wanna know about some sort of side stories which arent told in this trilogy, Id go and watch the original comics or series. Its a disgrace Marvel is letting some amature bastards, wanting some easy money in making another movie.ï»¿"
1816,"@jonath198 Yeah I agree, but that was pretty much the only scene in the trailer. There are trailers where everything is fucked up. Nevertheless I think this is one of the best movies in the world.ï»¿"
1817,"This was definetly the best of the trilogy, I dont understand people, complaining about it.ï»¿"
1818,Will it come a 4th of spiderman???ï»¿
1819,False Advertising. That's what these trailers were. ï»¿
1820,I think they should've fit ManSpider in this trilogy somewhereï»¿
1821,The Sandman effects were AMAZING!  It was like a sandy T-1000ï»¿
1822,"@Alex5Murphy If he mutates to adapt himself to the earthly environment, we'll get Carnage! (Now combine that with dr. Connors becoming the lizard.ï»¿"

1833,It could be better.I heard they wanted doctor Connors as the opponent.But they decided for Venom and Sandman.ï»¿
1834,Sandman was awful still i want a Flash Gordon movie.ï»¿
1835,"It pisses me off that this reboot is happening, & I see a lot of other people don't like it too much either. I'm serious guys, we should start a petition, revolution, or strike. We can go to Hollywood or New York anytime. We should start a group on Facebook or on Youtube, or a website! I'm serious guys, we have to do this. I really can't stand that the 4th was cut off in the making & it won't come out anymore. Please contact me, I'm dead serious!ï»¿"
1836,in the cartoons Eddie Brock was practically a bodybuilder and in this movie he is... Eric Forman?ï»¿

1856,"@amyjessful Just so you know, Tobey wasn't REPLACED. He quit because he didnt like working for sony, they were too harsh with him and the other cast. Just an FYI for you.ï»¿"
1857,"I love it when you retards say all this crap about spiderman and never really studied the facts of what really happened. Raimi did not ruin spiderman 3. He was forced to do things sony tells him to do. And why all this bashing with the reboot. It hasnt even come out yet. Why dont you losers wait till the movie comes out. And then critique the performance, until then . Keep your holes shut. Thank you and have a nice day. :)ï»¿"
1858,@123LittleBastard the spiderman 4 is most crap than this oneï»¿
1859,'this could be the end of Spiderman' ==> And it turned out to be :(ï»¿
1860,This movie was a crap. The first two movies were awesome but this one was ridiculous. Tobey is a GAY EMO and the movie was boring. I was hopping for a 4Â° movie but they will make a crap reboot...ï»¿
1861,batman gave back!!ï»¿
1862,"Raimi I hope you rot after what you did to us fans with this movie. Why did you have to include Venom, the most loved spider-man villian when you didn't care enough about him yourself to make him right? Why the atrocious clusterfuck of villians? Why? God oh why emo Parker walking down the street to Beegees? What were you thinking?! Oh thats right, you weren't. And now Drag Me to Hell? Evil Dead is one of my favorites but you've lost it man, you really really have. Do us a favor and stop.ï»¿"
1863,"I don't care what anyone says, I LOVED this movie! Favorite in the series actually.And I'm excited for the reboot too, ï»¿"
1864,@amyjessful Andrew Garfield is a far superior actor. Garfield is younger than Toby and has already produced a lot of fine performances. I'm not knocking Toby Maguire but Andrew is going to be around for a long time and it will only be a matter of a few years before the awards start coming in.ï»¿
1865,LOL childhood movies?? ar you all about 15!?ï»¿
1866,"@amyjessful Absolutely correct. I'm sorry, but the shoes that Tobey made are just too big to fill in. It's the same problem that we see now with the Superman series with Christopher Reeves.ï»¿"
1867,I loved this movie thought it was the best of the three i dont get why people dont like it. i grew up with those movies they were the bestï»¿

1871,i love this movie. sue meï»¿
1872,I FUCKING LOOOOVE SPIDERMANits my fav superhero and i love even more this movie and i dont konw why the fuck people hate this movie so much when it's got some awesome efects and story.Yes marvel changed a lot of thing from the original comics but they also leave AS MUCH AS POSIBLE AS THEY CAN!!.Cuz in comics they have YEARS to tell a story.But in movies they had maximum 150 minutes:/ .Soo stop saying all does bad things to this AMAZING MOVIE:).ï»¿
1873,@NyIzAwSoMe  you haven't even seen the movie yet ? ï»¿
1874,"@amyjessful I understand why you would be worried, but If you don't want to see it, I wouldn't blame you. Though I must admit, you would be missing out. This has happened many times- especially with superhero movies. Batman, superman, etc. . . The first one usually exposes the world to the character, then the reboot is more true to the comics. The new actor for spiderman will be the original spiderman: a teenager with issues. Tobey's portrayal was great, but the new one will be good too. ï»¿"
1875,"@amyjessful tobey isnt really a good actor. andrew doesnt seem all that great, but he'll prob do betterï»¿"
1876,@MrAhmed9229 HELL YESï»¿
1877,@amyjessful How will a new set of movies ruin your childhood? I think something like Spider-Man 3 does more damage than a reboot.Raimi's Spidey wasn't the first and it isn't going to be the last version of the character. I for one hope Webb's Spidey is actually funny.ï»¿
1878,"1st Spiderman- meh2nd- Enjoyed it but still had a little cheese here and there3rd- I think that they literally wiped their boogers on a peace of paper and called it the scriptI think that Amazing Spiderman will be better, it looks soooo much more well done, besides the first person part of the trailer.   ï»¿"
1879,"First 3 Movies Horrible, The Amazing Spiderman will be amazing nuff said. ï»¿"
1880,@amyjessful i feel bad for your childhood. even as a child the 3rd movie was a colossal disappointment and if anything a fresh start could exactly what spider man needs... ï»¿
1881,I've only seen this movie once since it came out which is when i watched it lol. i'm just now going to watch it again lol.ï»¿
1882,"Yeah, this trailer makes this looks awesome, but seriously, it was shocking.. The new spiderman with Andrew is gonna be awesome. ï»¿"
1883,They shouldn't make a remake. It's just wrong. The original will be waaaaaay better. It's like Spy Kids. People shouldn't remake something that's already qualityï»¿
1884,"This 'remake'  should prove beyond a shadow of  doubt that Hollywood has not even one shred of originality remainingPretty soon, they'll be doing remakes, of the remakeï»¿"
1885,"@amyjessful i tell you one thing...it's not his fault! tobey don't want do any movie of spiderman again, and spiderman 4 was cancelled because the problems of the script and bla bla bla...Â¬Â¬. ï»¿"
1886,they ruined spider man 4 by rebooting it Fucking assholesï»¿

1894,"I love Spider-Man too much to give a shit who does the films. This trilogy was great, but with the way SM4 was headed (with Felicia Hardy being a new villain called ""Vulturess""), I'm kinda glad they're rebooting. I'm hoping they get the Green Goblin right in this new trilogy, and make him the main antagonist of the series as a whole instead of just one movie. Plus, this new trilogy will hopefully explore new villains and plot devices. I fucking hope. ï»¿"
1895,Who ever likes the 3 movies of spider man and does not care about what other people think do thumbs up for me.ï»¿
1896,These were my favorite movies as a child. I was VERY excited for Spider-Man 4. Until I heard this was coming -.-ï»¿
1897,Actually not going to watch the new spiderman film out of principle. My childhood was also impacted by these films so fuck the new one. ï»¿
1898,"@amyjessful Why blame Marc Webb? Blame Sony. They're the ones who forced Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and co. to leave the film. If they had just pushed the release date back so the cast and crew would have more time, Spider-Man 4 and 5 would probably be coming outï»¿"
1899,niceï»¿
1900,@amyjessful gosh THANK U finally someone who has the same opinion as meï»¿

1905,@Dullfang2 I hated emo peter but I think that was the pointï»¿
1906,"Seriously I wanna KILL Marc Webb for replacing Tobey with Andrew!  Those 3 spider- man movies were my childhood, now it's all ruined with some other trash movie! I know that Tobey has kids, but spider-man won't be the same without him! Just you wait and see in the future what will happen to Andrew, just you wait.  Nuff Said.ï»¿"
1907,@Dullfang2 yeh i agree there but still it was still okï»¿

1911,"When the new guy goes ""This could be the end of Spider-man"", it says ""It was :(""ï»¿"

1920,"am i the only one that thinks the new one is going to be much better than these ones? i mean has anyone thats saying the new one is going to be shit actually read the comics? these ones were horrible, okay maybe the 2nd and first one where great but this one sure was horrible, stop judging the new one when he have literally only seen 2 minutes worth of footage. ï»¿"
1921,"@pakistar09 The comics are what the story is, the cartoon is wrong as well then. and learn to spell ;Dï»¿"

Fuck Garfield, Toby IS Spider-Man.ï»¿"

2075,"@abcldeefcgh No, this movie fucking SUCKED.  Why?  Because the story about SANDMAN was stupid, VENOM's character and persona was completely RAPED, PeterParker cried enough for all of the world's suffering, Mary Jane looked her ugliest, MJ Sang too much, Peter Danced too much, the kid at the end with the camera annoyed me, the ""forgiveness"" theme ended everything too quick, Harry dies, Venom dies, and my balls died after watching this atrocious excuse for a spidey flick!Spidey 2 = the best yet!ï»¿"

2078,"@abcldeefcgh  Maybe because we are Spidey fans and can't see something bad about it.

He asks forgiveness from Spidey  and to watch over his daughter. Then dies and Spider fights Venom for another 10 minutes and at the end Venom escapes promising revenge. Then the end the movie had but Spidey leaves to get Venom at the closing scene like SM or SM 2.ï»¿"

2092,"Ya know, this movie sucked (no offense) because Venom wasn't muscular!!!It more looked like Carnage! It would of looked better if some one like Arnold Schwarzenegger was Venom!!ï»¿"
2093,what kills these movies is they put too much comedic effect into it. when he got the suit he shouldn't have been walking down the street dancing all emo just to be funny. they should have made him an asshole. doing stuff to people. also some of the combat scenes when harry and peter team up i felt like it wasn't taken seriously at a certain point. now they are making a reboot and its gonna suck. and the next movie was gonna have vulture and carnage. and i'm pissed. fucking contracts.ï»¿

Harry could get killed in an accident but the end up forgiving each other(similar to the original film). Cue Ending scenes here. Any good?ï»¿"

2183,"@trex12evangelion venom's design was awful  and he doesn't even look like the real venom, and with the carnage subject i suposse they could  put the ultimate version because in the original he was a genocidal murder.ï»¿"
2184,i wanna kill the grandma . fuckface knows everything !ï»¿
2185,@kolaMAN95 James Dooley - trinity - position music.ï»¿
2186,What is the name of music in this trailer ?ï»¿
2187,If only the movie was as good as the trailer made it seemï»¿
2188,what song is in the trailer?ï»¿
2189,"@ardeilys Yup I read that too.   Sam only wanted I think Harry and The Lizard finally.  But fans kept bitching about Venom and so Sam had to push the date forward to 2007 instead of 2006 like it was suppose to be.  In all honesty its the fans who wanted Venom, it's their fault.  But yeah the movie was decent though.ï»¿"
2190,i hate this spiderman!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ï»¿
2191,@mushal7james7tony  yup dude nd megan fox wouldve been a perfect mary jane and would attract alot of attention to the francise =Dï»¿
2192,@ultratron562 I mean peter of causeï»¿
2193,@oxycodo the corny lines were the best!! <3ï»¿
2194,the black spiderman I don't know the name of it I think he's kinda awesome because he kicks everyone out of the wayand I'm so sick of ideal perfect good manï»¿
2195,"Goddanm it, the new actor isn't as same as Toby! I don't like it him replacing Toby x(ï»¿"
2196,"This was the worst Spiderman, it was too dramatic rather than having action like it should.ï»¿"
2197,"i've always thought this was the best spiderman, but i just never could get over the dramatic break up scene...ï»¿"
2198,"Eddie Brock only wants the Symbiote, causeÂ´ he can get a bigger mouth to speak shitï»¿"
2199,2:07 looks like it was predicted beforeï»¿
2200,spiderman 4: gonna suck without tobyï»¿
2201,1:31 ZILLA ROARï»¿
2202,"this movie sucked on so many levels! it rehashed themes used in the first 2 movies and had no real plot, so stupid how they shoehorned sandman into being uncle ben's alleged killer! first 2 movies used only 1 villain and that formula worked so why the fuck did they use 3 villains for this movie! sandman was a terrible villain and venom being played by topher grace wow what a horrible casting choice! venom could have been sweet but he wasnt it was just about peter and his dumb choices! FAILï»¿"
2203,@animalman1122 Exactly.I don't love him like others. but he is undeniably brilliant in this role.ï»¿
2204,I'm agreeing with some ppl thinking that this movie was bad. 1.great 2.good 3.okï»¿
2205,the power...feels good.ï»¿
2206,this is the most amazing movie i ever cï»¿
2207,@superJAK47 James Dooley - Trinityï»¿
2208,This movie is no.17 in the world-all-time-movie-chartsï»¿
2209,thumbs up if this movie made you cry :*(ï»¿
2210,"this movie kind of sucked... i mean, the first was awesomethe second was okand the third sucked like crap...ï»¿"
2211,what's the music at 0:18ï»¿
2212,@Sirdonnery It s James Dooley - Trinityï»¿
2213,This Movie Is The Best Superhero Movie Ever!ï»¿
2214,@thecarreyman2323 idk but they did it. lolï»¿
2215,"@Weezing336 Yeah, now that you mention it, Bane was pretty crap. How is it possible to screw over two awsome villains in one movie?ï»¿"
2216,"@thecarreyman2323 i agree about Two-Face. I could have never said it as good as you did. :) BUT about Mr. Freeze, I understand, but I personally feel that Bane was screwed most simply because he was used as a dumb (literally dumb) bodyguard for Poisen Ivy.ï»¿"
2217,"@Weezing336 Two Face from Forever was way better than in The Dark Knight. However, TDK Two-Face didn;t get enough screen time or a proper fight, so I would be saying different had he gotten a real fight.  But overall, Mr Freeze was screwed over the worstï»¿"
2218,"@lavendar2000 Well, it depends which Superman movie really. This film is crap, and compared to Superman or Superman 2, this dosen't stand a chance. But compare it to Superman 3, Superman 4 or Superman Returns, this looks like the best film ever madeï»¿"
2219,"@MoMeowProductions Dude, everyone loves Batman! He isn't emo,  he's just dark, and that's wat everyone loves about him. Plus, he had the best villainsï»¿"
2220,"Pros - Sandman looked awesome, we got to see Harry carry on the legacy, upside down Spider Man symbiote scene from the 90's cartoons, Mary Jane getting punched in the face, and great CGI overall.Cons - No actual plot..just random events, Harry becoming shitty new character that almost never wore his mask, idiotic dancing scenes/emo Parker, Venom never referred to himself as ""we"" or showed his wicked tongue, NO LIZARD, Harry acting like he was totally stoned after injury, Venom died too soon.ï»¿"
2221,"Horrible movie.Way to rape Venom, btw. ï»¿"
2222,"This movie was awful.     I got up and walked out during the end credits,  that's how fucking terrible it was.ï»¿"
2223,I want Spider-man remake :( Sam Raimi sucked bad. The scenario sucked bad too. And Tobey`s acting was like a total douche in the 2rd and 3rd part >.< Jerry Bruckheimer for producing Spider-man`s remake !!! Hooorey!ï»¿
2224,"@sonicX147 uhhh ""black spider man"" its call the symbiote costume! i know more about spider man that you u fucking little 12 year old, go back to ur little mommie an breast feed till you mature some moreï»¿"
2225,@sonicX147 Come down what's wrong with you??i said i don't hate marvel so good for you but i mean the dark knight has a sharper more creative and special plot especially the ending like if you're a superhero then everyone will turns against you and you have to be patient but i didn't say that spider man is gay so shut up and read the whole comment before replyingï»¿
2226,"i like how the reporter was like ""this could be the end of spider-man"" XD ahahahcan't wait for the reboot :)ï»¿"
2227,I don't hate this but The Dark knight is a lot better allthough i'm a DC Comics fan but that doesn't mean i hate Marvelï»¿
2228,EEPIIICï»¿
2229,I didn't like Spider-Man 3 because my favorite villain got so little screen time. Then he got killed at the end. ï»¿
2230,"I think this was the best of the movies! Although, third movies tend to be the best (i.e. LOTR, POTC, Twilight Saga, etc). It showed the depths of true friendship, true love, and the distinction between right and wrong and how cloudy that can be. I absolutely loved it! And cry every time at the end. But it was wonderful!ï»¿"
2231,I hope there will be Carnage or Lizard-man i next part!! :Dï»¿
2232,I wonder when Mary Jane's gonna ask Peter how he got his super powers...ï»¿
2233,I Love This Movie<3ï»¿
2234,thanks a bunch. i didnt know that program existed lol. u just saved me a lot of time and work when it comes to music.ï»¿
2235,"@zapper7 I found it on youtube, just type: Trinity - Position Music - By: James DooleyYou can download it with ""youtube to mp3""Google the program ;)ï»¿"
2236,where can i get the music from this trailerï»¿
2237,"If they would have made Peter a little more aggressive, a lot less emo, and saved venom for Spider-Man 4, the series wouldn't be getting rebooted. Fucking Sony.ï»¿"
2238,"This movie was not bad. It was actually probably the most fun one to watch. The things that brought it down were the korny lines, some cleshe fighting, and the Goblin looked like a snowboarder they should have made the new goblin look like the guy from deadspace or somethin. o and not enough venom. Topher wasnt bad, he just didnt have much to work withï»¿"
2239,"@jhonen32629 yeah when i saw that film i said ""what?....are you still at the same movie......?..................is this a commercial of pepsi or what""ï»¿"
2240,Topher grace and Tobey Maguire remind me of each other. Hmm.ï»¿
2241,w8 in the movie i saw him taking the suit out then he cant take it off does that black think have a brain or wht?ï»¿
2242,"The first half of this movie is good, but what the fuck was Sam Raimi on when he thought it was a good idea for Peter Parker to act like a pimp and randomly dance in the middle of the streets?ï»¿"
2243,I remember when this came out it was THE movie to see. Now the their making another. Hope it's as good as the rest of the movies.ï»¿
2244,@1last3hero i think Venom was not done right at all but we all have our own opinionï»¿
2245,Do you know that it fades to black 36 times in this trailer? >.>ï»¿
2246,"The trailer music is ""Trinity"", by James/Jim Dooleyï»¿"
2247,"loved this movie, alot of things happen. ï»¿"
2248,i think it was a good movie but what killed it was how spiderman didnt really fight the actual venom more..that would have been much more intense..ï»¿
2249,"@cybersunday07 Agree. In my opinion it was the best of the three - design, music, vilians, story... Everything was better. BUT the first two movie is not bad either (hm ok... the first was not sooo good ><). It's jut better I think. Good stuff from Hollywood. ;)But my favorite is still Bruce Wayne. 8)ï»¿"
2250,"I still wonder which comic villain got screwed worse, Mr. Freeze (""Batman and Robin""), Bane (""Batman and Robin""), Two-Face (""batman Forever""), or Venom (""Spiderman 3"")ï»¿"
2251,"@cybersunday07  dont really care about critics or YOUR opinion, the movie was bad,it was clear to me while watching the movie was pieced toguether as they went. not a big deal many movies are like that, but it was obvious they didnt know what to do and the result was that.ï»¿"
2252,pff it only takes one bad recoil from fans and critics and we have a reboot...its not like this movie was horrible...i liked the quirks in itï»¿
2253,"@bladerj - No, this was the best of the three.All of you just seem to agree with what the critics say, no idea why as they're idiots who wouldn't know a good movie if it jumped out of the ocean and slapped them in the face, or blew up half of new york.Best movie of 2007.ï»¿"
2254,"This trailer is EPIC, but unfortunelly as noted by my fellow peers, much better then the movie :Pï»¿"
2255,i saw the sandman guy at the gymï»¿
2256,@spiderfreak1011 sry! i thought that's what I HEARD! ï»¿
2257,"Spiderman 4 will be released in theaters on July 3rd, 2012. It will be in 3D. Tobey Maguire/Peter Parker will be replaced by Andrew Garfield.ï»¿"
2258,@HAYU571018031  And your point is...?ï»¿
2259,"@HauntingBlackness Thanks, dude!) But my question is: This is the exact quote? Word for word? Just I'm looking for the subtitles ... nothing found.. ï»¿"
2260,MJ: we've all done terrible things to each other. but we have to forgive each other. or everything we ever were will be nothing. ï»¿
2261,I'm very bad speak English ... please write a passage: (1:51-1:57). Please!..ï»¿
2262,hey this was the first youtube video i ever saw. i have good memoryï»¿
2263,"@TheStokesman Look up the film ""The Forgotten Spartans Part 7"" and it will tell youï»¿"
2264,"The film could of been gold if they did not fuck Venom up - Spider Man 1 and 2 were fine the way they were, if they had just kept Sandman and New Goblin as the villians in SP3 the series would still be alive. Still, the reboot should be awesome if they go along the Ultimate Spider Man story - which imo is on par with the classic tales, if not better!ï»¿"
2265,Whats the song in this video?ï»¿
2266,I just wanna know who plays peter parker better than tobey maguire!ï»¿
2267,"@FEARfilmz yep this movie is JUST AS awesome as 1 & 2, Spidey 3 is so underrated and screw the reboot!ï»¿"
2268,idc anyone says this movie is awesome fuck the rebootï»¿
2269,they probably should just gave spidey 1 or 2 enemies in this movie. this movie is a disaster.ï»¿
2270,"Great trailer, horrible movie.... So sad, this was suppose to be the greatest Spider-Man movie of all with the black suit, Venom and Sandman plus the Harry as Goblin... Geez, they fucked this film up so bad...ï»¿"
2271,"@donovanpitt24 No, it wasn't released on the soundtrack album, but the song is called Trinity by James Dooley. You can find it on YouTube !ï»¿"
2272,did they have a soundtrack for the trailerï»¿
2273,1:38 - 2:20 EPICï»¿
2274,1:58 to end is my favorite partï»¿
2275,trailer was better then the movieï»¿
