"I dont wonder if people praising this movie loads about how good the CG was, how advanced the movie was for its time, really  got Cameron's political message. It's so blatantly explicit but I was surprised why it wasn't shunned away by people in the US. The whole movie was a way of giving middle finger off to the US's uncontrollable greed towards natural resources and its arrogant invasion into other countries. Clearly the movie won and it sends a signal that people in the US are against what their own government has been doing all along.ï»¿"

"""this is your avatar"" l am from India. And l am confused bcz, according to hindu mythology gods are having their respective ""avatars"" at different stages of life time for certain puposes .Is that what meant here Anybody??? 2018ï»¿"
"Arjun Kakkavayal Yes that is what it meant, in an interview James Cameron himself said that the title of the movie referenced incarnation of Hindu gods ""Avatar"" in the real world.ï»¿"
"I wonder if part 2 will even get close to the earnings of the first one. Don't think so. The factors that lead the first part to its near $3B march (3D and all) aren't really that important. And the 2000's were ruled by fantasy genre (PotC, LotR, HP, Avatar). The same can't be said about the current wave as it is ruled by comicbook movies. Even if James Cameron makes a sequel that is  good beyond expectations, the movie will still fail to touch $2B mark because it simply lacks the technical wonders that led the first part to its success. Every movie is a technical wonder these days so Avatar 2 won't stand out like its predecessor. And it will release 11 years after the first part. Will people really care by then?Although I really do hope the 2nd part lives up to the hype and turns out to be a financial success so that Jim Cameron can make the 5 sequels he promised.ï»¿"

I will watch this movie because im fcking curious why tf no movies can beat its 2.7B Gross // im a big fan of MCUï»¿
"AceErick B MCU is not popular accross the world. Avatar became a must watch event in many countries due to its rich imaginary world and CGI. A movie can't reach 2.7B with just US, European markets. It should be a worldwide phenomenon.ï»¿"
"Harish KL just watched Avatars, and no doubt it is a beautiful movie, but sorry, MCU will not reach 2billions in 1 month if it is not popular and not a phenomenon. Biggest opening grossing? Oh come on.ï»¿"
AceErick B Well...it is important to understand what made IW reach 2B. 18 supporting movies. Incredible marketing in the current smartphone frenzy era. Avatar had none of that advantage. Just word of mouth. Avatar grossed 2B in international markets which is incredible. MCU needs some more time to pull off such an international markets. Domestic MCU is King.ï»¿
"Harish KL lmao, IW gained 2b not just because of its supporting movies, it is the movie by itself its amazing effects, story timeline and many aspects brought it to 2b. and btw, IW is not the only movie gained 2b from MCU, Avatar is a good movie, but let me tell you this, IW is far better than it _Ÿ_·_Ÿè»â€çâ™‚ï¸èï»¿"
"AceErick B I don't like Avatar for story. I like it for its CGI. Also, movie success is just box office numbers and Avatar is still the undisputed King and IW can't beat. For me IW is a fanboy movie (I am an MCU fan).    It's just another generic superhero movie technically not groundbreaking. If non MCU person goes to see IW he will yawn. He will not know how avenger know each other. He has to see older MCU movies.ï»¿"

"""I do not agree that the dog in a manger has the final right to the manger even though he may have lain there for a very long time. I do not admit that right. I do not admit for instance, that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia. I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, has come in and taken their place.""Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill.

The only reason this movie made billions at the box office was coz it had a massive amount of publicity and advertisemenrï»¿
"One of the biggest disappointments is this film  AVATAR .Far too long , too predictable, parcially boring and after 40 minutes of looking at those tall, blue and weird creatures with long tails ,the so called navis , all i wanted was to see real people , real human beings ...The story is poor , just a copy of other old films , such as Tom Cruise's THE LAST SAMURAI ,which is a much better choice , DANCE WITH THE WOLVES and others.A TYPICAL EXAMPLE WHEN THE ESPECIAL EFFECTS. OVERPOWER THE STORY .Even the cast doesn' t help , with the exception of ALIEN""S actress S. Weaver.And Sam Worthington doesn't convince as a hero , he s wooden as an actor.The visual , the striking colours and the world created by J. Cameron really impress at first , but it s just not enough to support a movie.Even one of my friends who is a film fanatic and watches 3 new films per week and has a. big collection of new and old films , when he went to the cinema to watch AVATAR.,he came back and said. : the film is just crap , in his own words....For me AVATAR is just a kid 's film Nothing else.And. in an era when the biggest tropical forest in the world BRASIL 'S AMAZONAS. is being cut down , a big treath of today's, the HAPPY END of AVATAR looks false , unrealistic and untruthfulAnd finally if u want to watch a good , original sci-fiction movie fantasy try DISTRICT 9 ,  THE ENDER'S  GAME. (Harrison Ford) or computer animated fantasies  BEOWULF ,  Del Toro""s, PAN 'S LABYRINTH , STAR DUST , Frank Miller s 300. and more , as there are plenty films far  better than thisï»¿"

"Hi. I adore Avatar by James Cameron. It seems that I need some help. One question bothers me. Quaritch tells Jake Sully: â€œVenezuela, that was some mean bushâ€ù. Venezuela?   I am not certain that they presume country in America Latina. Cameron thoroughly elaborates all details and I do not think that he or script writer selected that name accidentally. May be they presume another planet? May be they really presume some armed conflict on earth? (May be I am an idiot and I ask a stupid question?)ï»¿"
Niceï»¿
AVATAR and TITANIC are the two greatest movies ever directed and my favourite. Avatar earned 760 mn US$ in US and 2.8 billion $ around the world. Titanic sold 140 million tickets in US in 1997; more than any of that star wars crap (except for the 1977 one) only 2 movies in US sold more tickets than Titanic- 1977 star wars and 1939 gone with the wind. Avatar's 100 mn tickets was a huge success. Both these movies are still the top two earners worldwide and among top 3 in US. these are the only two movies to get collosal success and popularity in both US and overseasï»¿
who is watching it now?ï»¿
Oh look its Alex masonï»¿
That's selfishï»¿
"I feel like you can only enjoy this movie if you were there when it came out. It's not really that unique story and character-wise, but the technical side of it was amazing at the time. Seeing it the first time in 3D with the amazing visuals and sound design has been one of my favorite movie theater experiences.ï»¿"
"A story doesnt have to be unique it's the underlining message and people like you is why the world is a mess, just enjoiy the film and try to look at the message it conveys, there's a reason why people make films like these again and again, this isn't the last time you'll see a film like thisï»¿"
"Well, your feeling is wrong. I enjoyed it :)ï»¿"
Cheeto very very wrong! it was truly amazing.ï»¿
Shady Chile I'm wrong to think that it's good because you think it's good? Did i misunderstand you?ï»¿
Cheeto no the wrong part had absolutely nothing to do with you. i was talking to the original commenter who thought the movie was only good during that time. i was agreeing with you that theyâ€™re wrong. very very wrong.ï»¿
"Shady Chile ohh, sorry, thenï»¿"
"Stop getting so triggered, you may enjoy it now but what he mean's is when it first came out it was way ahead of it's time and a mindblowing experience where as you see these animated movie's around a lot more often so it's not so special anymore, no one is saying it's a bad movie but we're saying when it first came out it was bloody amazing you can't say you found it bloody amazing maybe you did but not on the same level we did.ï»¿"
Katie RBLX â€œnot on the same level we didâ€ù please shut the fuck up. if anyone here is triggered itâ€™s you. but thanks for your opinion it was noted.ï»¿
"I see how that can come off as rude, but it isnt intended to it's just nowaday's there are a lot of movie's like that so nothing make's them ""stand out"" where as when this first came out everyone was amazed seeing it in the Cinema was a great experience, it's still one of the best movie's to watch and top's a lot of animated movie's that are out today, since the budget was HUGE!, just not the 'same' that's all.ï»¿"
Im watching it now infact so I wont be replying.ï»¿
"Katie RBLX most sentences starting off with â€œstop getting so triggeredâ€ù come off rude but no worries. i watched this movie so long ago i didnâ€™t remember anything so i rewatched, and loved it. if you have a love of movies, you can enjoy it just as much. imo _Ÿ_·_Ÿè_â€çâ™€ï¸è but ik the budget had to be unbelievable lmao.ï»¿"
"Stop getting triggered for me at least is a newer way of saying calm down, People who have a love for movie's will watch load's that have this type of animation and cgi already, just wanted to point out that back then it was so ""new"" ""unseen"" And special. But it's still a movie that'll make you cry (atleast for me) I still find the animation amazing especially with the Nav'is eyes. (Fun fact the budget was a whopping 237 million USD)! (Nvm turns out a lot of movies have that kind of budget wow didnt realise how much money director's had to blow)ï»¿"
"Jonathan Morales, dude this was not the first movie in 3d . Idiotï»¿"
Jonathan Morales i remember watching this when i was small and i loved itï»¿
"I differ on that, as I never saw it in the theater, but have enjoyed it multiple times at home. Plenty of stories are based on well-established models and that's neither here nor there to me. Avatar is simple and straightforward, which I respect. And the visual aspect is still incredibly beautiful on a smaller screen.ï»¿"
if a movie must be seen in the theatre and relies only on visual effects it's not a good movieï»¿
Yeah lol movie itself is pretty forgettableï»¿
"Digital Wizard ""people like you is why the world is a mess""Way to blow it out of proportion, you self righteous lowlife.ï»¿"

Spiro312 Ew be more clever next time.ï»¿
"+Spiro312 Mistakes are what makes the world go round, bud. Without them, you can't learn or grow as an individual. And if you can't do either of those things, then yeah.What I really want to know is why everyone is blowing things out of proportions? The original comment never said anything about not enjoying the movie. Only that in terms of plot, the movie is original now but wasn't back in 2009, which is the truth. We live in an era where movie directors have even tried to take Jason into space. JASON.ï»¿"
why are people getting so upset over his opinion? I mean I disagree with him but you guys are being annoyingï»¿
Digital Wizard  You are literally blaming all of the world's problems on a person who doesmt share the same opinion as you. Lolï»¿

infinity war is comingï»¿
"lol infinity war came a bit short, about a billion short.ï»¿"
"All these people mentioning Infinity War are funny, as if it will come anywhere close to Avatar let alone beating it. Jokes on youï»¿"
"Infinity war now number 4 box office worldwide, even cant bet star wars the force awakensï»¿"
Infinity war was a better movie thoughï»¿
"We won't be alive when this record is shatter. No movie is ANYTIME SOON making more than Avatar's $2.78 billion or even come close to it. A lot of people don't realize Avatar made like 70% of it's entire money on pure 3d, there's no way a movie like Infinity War would shatter it.ï»¿"
Maybe avengers 4ï»¿
"Avengers 3 made so much money, just hit $2 billion, and broke so many records. I highly doubt Avengers 4 will do the same. And keep in mind, It is the culmination of 10 years of the Marvel Studios and connects the story of an unprecedented 18 consecutive movies, everyone couldnt wait to finally see Thanos. Avengers 4 won't have the hypeï»¿"
It's not beating neither of them globallyï»¿
Nothingï»¿
"Gone with the Wind. Enough said.ï»¿"
Ha! Even Infinity War couldn't break this movies record.ï»¿
"All you guys mentioning Infinity war, now it's even struggling to beat the record of TFA ww and Black panther in domestic. Don't say avengers 4 is gonna beat it cuz its legacy of 10 years of marvel studios, Avatar was a lifetime achievement of a director.ï»¿"
All credit goes to 3D releaseï»¿
"PP Seminole lol! yeah, it's the fourth highest grossing film of all time but it still falls short of around 700 million dollars to beat Avatar or even Titanic. So what happened to the hype? _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿"
mutant messiah Its forgettable as every MCU movieï»¿
black panther earned 1 billion $ bruh.ï»¿
PP Seminole noï»¿
Infinity war is 2.046 billion and avatar is 2.788 billionï»¿
The only movie which has and will have the potential to beat Avatar is Avatar 2 (and 3).ï»¿
"Infinity war will not beat Avatar and neither will any other movie unless theirs a big innovation. The reason how avatar made so much was because it was the first and only real 3D movie. Infinity war made 2 billion in the box office which is 700 million behind Avatar, close to beating titanic. P2 May get close but I canâ€™t see any movie really being watched as much as Avatar was as theyâ€™s no innovation, itâ€™s been done before, all movies use the CJI affects which Avatar made popular. Not even Avatar 2 will come close to the original as people just arenâ€™t that interested in seeing movies in the cinema anymore and theyâ€™s no hype around something new like 3Dï»¿"
"Adhiraj no,He only way a movie can outsell AVATAR is a movie which innovates massively and has something like 3D or something to get people to go and see it. Avatar was so popular because of its amazing CJI which could be mistaken for a movie made today, and itâ€™s perfect release time when 3D was widely popular and this movie was advertised as the best 3D movie out their and honestly was.ï»¿"

The Oscar-winning director is currently busy filming four sequels back-to-back in New Zealand, with the first being pushed back a year.â€œThis film is going to be like nothing you've ever seen. The world is bigger than the first one, but essentially, it's a movie about family.

"| Official Trailer (HD) | 20th Century FOX |#AVATAR | takes us to a spectacular world beyond imagination, where a reluctant hero embarks on an epic adventure, ultimately fighting to save the alien world he has learned to call home. James Cameron, the Oscar-winning director of Titanic, first conceived the film 15 years ago, when the means to realize his vision did not exist yet. Now, after four years of production, AVATAR, a live action film with a new generation of special effects, delivers a fully immersive cinematic experience of a new kind, where the revolutionary technology invented to make the film disappears into the emotion of the characters and the sweep of #theStory.ï»¿"

"The hilarious thing about this movie is that, even though it's been seven years since the first movie: James Cameron has four sequels planned to this turd and thinks he can get each of them done in two years. lolololololololololololol.ï»¿"
"What do you think he's been doing the last 7-8 years then? Just sitting in his couch and staring at the ceiling or something? The guy has been working on writing all 4 scripts for the sequels and designing more technology when it comes to camera sets and visual effects to achieve his vision. Just recently it was reported that he officially completed writing all 4 scripts and filming is expected to officially begin this August. The guy had 8 years to prepare for EVERYTHING with sequels and now it's really happen. Don't underestimate James Cameron either. With those 8 years preparing, he can get those films done in two years if he wanted too.ï»¿"
"Yeah, I can see the headlines now... Avatar 2: it took 12 years to make!ï»¿"
"as I've gotten older, I believe this movie is based off the Native Americans. The white man came in and invaded their land and attempted to kill them and take what belong to the natives. I'm not saying that was Hollywood's intent, but that's the sense I get when I watch this.ï»¿"
"Basically, they are after a valuable material so they try to drive them out of their homeland in order to obtain it. It sounds a lot like the struggle of the Sioux nation.ï»¿"
"@Callum Thomas I agree. My fiance is Native American and she was the first to bring to my attention. It doesn't make me dislike the movie or anything, but I would like to ask the writers if they were sending a subliminal message.ï»¿"
"It was literally Dances with wolves and Pocahontas in space James Cameron intended it to be about the native Americansï»¿"
"@Betito117 my only question is, is James Cameron looking to be disrespectful or just tell a story when it comes to native americansï»¿"
"After seeing the trailer, I was convinced that the aliens were evil and the marines were the good guys. But then I saw the movie in theaters and figured out that the blue people were just trying to protect their home. They had no intention of being a menace to the human race like other sci-fi movies. In other words, the humans were the real d bags. Greedy bastards trying to take everything from them for profit because of how poorly we treated our world, as we still are doing now. Loved this movie back then, and I still love it.ï»¿"

"Humans on an alien planet, but them being the danger to the natives of the planet. Making the humans the aliens, and the natives, the ones fighting for survival. Best storyline twist I've seen.ï»¿"

if you needed a video to explain to you why this a great movie then maybe you arent too bright.ï»¿
"Well, most of it's gross came from a worldwide audience. A worldwide audience who probably didn't see this movies that came before this and were very similar. So it was essentially a worldwide deal rather than just a big hit in the U.S.The immersive experience by the then revolutionary 3D also helped.ï»¿"
FlyingFocs no it was mainly the 3d immersive experience. And the world that James Cameron created. There was actually people crying and depressed right after the movie ended because reality had hit them right on the head lolï»¿

"I wonder if people realised how political this movie is. Basically ecologist stance left wing stance against right wing capitalism.

"I just want to come here and congratulate Avatar again for being the highest grossing film worldwide of all time, there's no movie released in the past 6 years even coming close to approaching that $2.78B figure. and who knows when that record may be broken, hopefully when some movie breaks that record, it will be a deserving one (unlike certain rehash of a certain 1977 film).ï»¿"

"+jianfei shao huh well most movie take the domestic box office as their true success, you know where the movies are made in the united states , and Star wars ep. 7 is crushing Avatar in that area.

"+Cran KaDub Sadly, this is far more original than SW7.ï»¿"

"@Gus BostdorfÂ In comparison to VII, yeah, actually. The worldbuilding and unique setting aspects, absolutely. VII doesn't exactly put a very high bar up there to beat, when it comes to originality.Â ï»¿"
Yeah a planet where there is no oxygen for humans to breathe but an abundant of giant trees that would naturally create oxygen. Talk about 'unique settings aspects' lolï»¿
"+Gus Bostdorf If you have done your research, you would have realised that there is oxygen on the planet. The problem is that the planet is also full of other gases that make it toxic to humans.ï»¿"
+gjesus051 but the toxins are dangerous only to humans but not towards any other life forms such as the trees or the nine foot tall blue cat people? Sounds like lame writing.ï»¿
"+Gus Bostdorf You must be dumb. It is obvious that it won't affect the life forms on pandora because they live there and were born there. The organisms are all adapted for the environment that they live but since you are the ""smart"" one here, you have probably already realized that.ï»¿"
"+gjesus051 Earth's atmosphere is only 21 percent oxygen while the vast majority of our atmosphere  is 79 percent nitrogen. The human body can regulate the toxic gases on earth. So a moon full of ginormous trees and lush plant life should be able to produce enough oxygen for at least humans to breathe if it can support large life forms. The humans bodies should be able to regulate the poisonous gases. For a habitable celestial body to be similar to earth but yet contain some random poisonous gas too dangerous for humans means it would be a very deadly gas to any life beings making it even difficult for simple life forms. Life will find a way but life follows the same universal equation. Life needs water, ability to reproduce, cellular organization, energy source and OXYGEN.  What would this random toxic gas be? Clearly not natural, only fictional.ï»¿"
+gjesus051 could you explain what this toxic gas is since I'm dumb. So why would jake be grasping instead of coughing out the toxins? Also maybe you could give me a lecture of the amazing magnetic floating rocks that are powerful enough to lift mountains but not affect any of the human instruments or metal equipment? Lol you seem to be quite the expert hereï»¿
"You might have to wait longer than what you would've presumed. Avatar will reign for a good while. Heck, TFA might not pass Titanic. It hasn't yet reach 2B and its dropping fast at the box office.ï»¿"
"Yes at the worldwide box office, avatar will be at top but The force awakens is number one at the North American box office. Avatar did so well becuz of the expensive 3D tickets which boost it's total gross but it's legacy will be remembered as a novelty.ï»¿"
Avatar was the first movie to be filmed with 3D cameras. It was a first of a kind. The 3D tickets were averaging 13 dollars but now the demand has gone down therefore tickets are cheaper than they were six years ago. Star Wars is a cultural event while avatar is only a bump in cinema history.ï»¿
It doesn't matter where you come from. You need to consider all theaters plus the majority of customers aren't going for the IMAX experience. Avatar has a movie is ehh.ï»¿
"People went to see it 3D which created so much buzz. Thus people went to see it in regular format becuz it the most talked about movie. It was a trickle down effect. Plus in china, everyone saw it in 3D causing huge revenue for worldwide gross. However BB-8 will outlast blue cat people.ï»¿"
"+danbh84 yea but when Avatar first came out, more people were buying the IMAX 3D tickets than the regular ones to see Avatar on 3D, while Force Awakens didn'tï»¿"

I thought it would be stupid and boring. Boy was I wrong. My family forced me to go with them to the theaters to see it. In total, we ended up seeing that film about 3 times. Once in IMAX. The soundtrack is very soothing to the ears. The visuals are absolutely stunning especially in IMAX. The actors were great and it really gives off a good message. It's like Star Wars, Romeo and Juliet, Jungle Book type stuff all put into one film. Really great honestly. It's my second favorite film after Battle Royale.ï»¿"

"BoyDanny93 this movie had no cultural impact though. it looked great but it the plot wasnt exactly anything special. the only impact this movie had, was that every movie nowadays has to have a 3d option for no reasonï»¿"
"Its the emotional resonance of the story.Everyone has a home, everyone knows how painful it is to lose it.ï»¿"
"BoyDanny 93 Avatar movie doesn't have crazy story because it's grounded.Yeah... It's si fi movie, it has its own fantasy, but it's more naturalistic than surreal.Fight Club - another masterpiece, in contrast to Avatar has a very crazy story telling with a perceptible heavy plot twist. But it's a surrealistic movie, so it has a surrealistic storytelling.The way that Avatar was filmed (was told) carefully, accurate, and smooth way without abrasive rough twists, is only right way to show that movie. It's a straight, beautiful, perfect legend, without hard shapes.ï»¿"
"At long last, I've found you...ï»¿"
"All these comparisons between Avatar (2009) and Star Wars (2015) are completely irrelevant.They're both good movies and people will like 1 more than the other. Just keep in mind that all of these effects and quality animations in Star wars have had many more years to be perfected and used well since Avatar did.

a movie like this wasn't made before. Now a days 3D is added to movie just for the sake of it..like martian..it didn't have anything special that it could be enjoyed in 3D. This movie was a milestone for 3D movies. Pathbreakingï»¿
"+jose miranda because the groundbreaking visual effects of the movie made it 2x better, something most people have never witnessed. they were so beautiful to the point, people don't even pay attention to the story plot of the movie, that's what captured people's attention. Some people were even watching this movie twice a daynow just imagine watching Avatar on IMAX 3D, it was freakin mind-blowing to the point, you're gonna say ''i want more''  It was so crazy that more people were paying to watch Avatar in theaters on IMAX 3D than regular. No movie in history has done that, making more money in it's IMAX screenings than regular screenings. You can ask anyone ''what was the best imax 3d movie they ever experienced in theaters, most will say Avatar.Â Keep in mind that watching a movie on IMAX cost between $15 and 20 much more than Regular per person. Also remember Avatar was making like 20 million on average for an entire year. Now you do the math, that will tell you why Avatar made so much moneyï»¿"
"This movie made so much money, because of the hype created by advertisements, trailers, the director previous hits, such as Titanic, the outstanding 3D effects, the special effects, the people who show the movie were so amazed by the 3D and the effects that they watched the movie in cinemas more than once, they also recommended it to everyone, the newspapers made stories about the fans going to the cinema many times, the critics review were good, it was nominated to so many Oscar awards. That's why it generated so much money.And yes it would be stupid for Cameron and the studio not to make another one considering the incredible success of the movie, considering the amount of fans it has, and the fact that the story isn't finished, and there is still much more to explore in Pandora now that Jake leaves his human body and becomes a native. Avatar 2 will make billions again, as soon as the trailer comes watch how the hype builds even higher than Star Wars.ï»¿"
"@jose miranda you underestimate the story a bit, the movie has a lot of political message, it explores issues such as the colonisation, invasion of countries, nations entering wars for money, like US does, the good vs evil theme that always does good in cinemas, the poor vs the rich and powerful which makes it relatable to most people...The 3D is part of the experience of this movie, it's not just adding 3D for the sake of it, in this movie 3D looked good and made sense as it felt like people were exploring a new planet for real, the planet of Pandora looked very beautiful and seeing it in 3D such as the floating maintains made it all really cool, the effects were advanced for the era and the new movie is also more advance with new technology that no other movie has used yet, they have even filmed scenes in the deepest area of the Pacific Ocean, which is an area unexplored and never seen before in media.The acting was also very strong and the soundtrack made it more epic than it should have been. All this components is what makes a movie a top grossing movie. This movie didn't succeed because of Titanic. I remember like it was yesterday when it came out and no one absolutely no one was talking about Titanic when Avatar came out.Calling it a expensive smurf movie is undertaking it for the sake of lowering the value of this movie, if this movie wouldn't have made so much money, you wouldn't be under rating it as much.ï»¿"
"@ERNESERNES do i think it deserved all the money it made? Hell no. Do i think this movie would have made the amount it did back when it was released? Not a chance. Do i think the acting was very strong? No. It was like watching a cross between star trek and a cartoon, Even Sigourney weaver's acting wasnt great. It was a movie sold on hype and not for being great. The geeks (me being one who didnt fall for it) were thrown some cheese in 3D and they flocked to go see it. Do i think it will make alot of money? I hope not, but these are humans and humans flock to whatever is trending no matter if its good or not, just like iphone usersï»¿"
@jose miranda nothing sells like a success if the people who watch it don't think it's good what they bought. People who watched this movie weren't geeks.ï»¿

I was confused when this wasn't about Aangï»¿
Cameron wrote this movie as Project 880 in 1994 before coming up with the name Avatar and he wanted to film it in 1997 for a 2000 release date but decided that the technology wasn't on par or there just to satisfy his notions and had to wait until the technology gets betterï»¿

"I love Avatar, cheers for the highest grossing film of all time worldwide, record ongoing for 6 years now. And I don't care how much hate the film gets.ï»¿"
"+jianfei shao Avatar thrived on people watching it in 3D for MONTHS on end in the theaters (Avatar stayed in theaters till August 2010, eight months total). Also, 6 years is NOT that impressive. E.T. held the record for 10 years, Birth of a Nation (1915) for 23 years, and Gone with the Wind was unmatched in box office gross for 25 years. The real question is, will Avatar 2 be able to top Star Wars Episode VII, which I GUARANTEE you will beat out Avatar by next year.ï»¿"
"+uncensorer  So what? Every successful movie had to thrive on something, I can also argue that the original Star Wars thrived on lack of competition, no piracy, lack of TV entertainment, lack of big screen TV, lack of DVD/BluRay/VHS Market, and a whole lot of other factors which could not exist to benefit any film released today. As a result, people rushed back to theater to see Star Wars again and again and again because that's the only way they can see it, and there's not much alternatives. Avatar pushed the boundries of 3D to a point no film has done before, and it deserves to get that credit.ï»¿"
"+uncensorer  Oh, and the Force Awakens is going to thrive on huge nostalgia and the benefit of a established franchise, as well as IMAX and 3D showings. In fact, I'd say it is more impressive for a original movie coming out of nowhere to be highly successful in box office (Avatar) than a highly anticipated movie from a big franchise (The force awakens).ï»¿"
"+uncensorer  Highest grossing film of all time for 6 years is quite impressive considering that the original star wars only held it for 5 years or so. (Before ET overtook it), and no Star Wars film (no matter how successful) was able to claim this title back. The Force Awakens may have a chance of overtake Avatar domestically, but we're talking about worldwide highest grossing film of all time, and Avatar isn't about to let that record go to The Force Awakens, we can bet on that and I will come back when The Force Awakens fails to do so.ï»¿"
"My question is (and I find this quite funny), if Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, The Phantom Menace, and Revenge of the Sith came nowhere close to all time highest grossing film globally, what makes you think The Force Awakens can do it? You think Avatar is that easy to overtake?ï»¿"

All I ever wanted was a single thing worth fighting for. - Ladies and gentlemen, youâ€™re not in Kansas anymore, youâ€™re on Pandora. - You should see your faces. - We have an indigenous population called the Novi. They are very hard to kill. - This is why weâ€™re here, because this little grey rock sells for 20 million a kilo. Their village happens to be resting on the richest deposit and they need to re-locate. Those savages are threatening our whole operation. Weâ€™re on the brink of war and youâ€™re supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution. - The concept is to drive these remotely controlled bodies called avatars. Theyâ€™re grown from human DNA mixed with DNA of the natives. - A marine in an avatar body, thatâ€™s a potent mix. - You get me what I need Iâ€™ll see to it you get your legs back. Your real legs. - Hell yeah sir. - Looks like you. This is your avatar. - Just relax and let your mind go blank. Shouldnâ€™t be hard for you. - Jake, itâ€™s real simple. - I want you to learn from the inside, I want you to gain their trust. - You should not be here. Go back.

"@legomattanddino MaherÂ I don't want to sound like this is any of my business, but aren't you just basing the your comment of 'majority liked it is false' off just opinions of people you've met? I personally liked it, and  seeing as the movie got at least a 75% liking from most reliable sites, this kinda states that majority of people should like it anyway. and back to the 'diehard fans' - isn't that what being a diehard fan is about? (when people don't find it important to have revolve some time of their life around it but these people do, so the only reason you find a lot of diehard fans talking about certain movies/tv shows is because they are usually the only people who like it enough to revolve their life around it. Sorry this comment is so long, just my complete and honest opinion - not trying to pick a fight.ï»¿"
"@legomattanddino MaherÂ Thanks, And yeah, i agree with 4 sequels being a bit much, maybe 1 more would be good (imo).

"The reason Avatar 2 is taking so long is because James Cameron is shooting the film in higher frame rate which as he stated takes the glass out of the window to reality. This would imply that either a downgraded version would be required for release in majority of theatres across the world or this movie would be a pioneer in the attempts to get a higher frame rate into cinemas worldwide. Avatar 2, 3 and 4 have all confirmed to be released back to back 2017, 2018 and 2019 filming non stop. I think it's one the most ambitious film projects ever undertaken.

"+tulley vaughan I like the way people like Cameron try to push technology for the film industry to the next level, but honestly I'm not  really a big fan of these higher frame rate, 3D and/ or Ultra HD Movies. The movement, when you shoot in hfr, looks a lot more ""natural"" which we don't know from movie. It often ends up looking stranger than using the same old smooth 25 or 24 (depending on where you live) frames per second. I don't say that it can't look good but a lot of people even disliked the hobbit because it was too ""jumpy"" and they got headaches because of the higher frame rates. The same with 3D. It can look good on the right kind of project. And the new 4K hype is great, I love to work with 4K footage because it gives a lot of freedom to crop or stabilise without losing quality, and filmmakers used 4K already for quite a while I just don't know if we need our general movie to be in 4K.Don't get me wrong, personally I love all of these things and often enjoy watching them on the right kind of project, but in the end its just a style choice and should be treated as suchï»¿"

One of those things is developing watching in 3D without glasses to aid.Here's the thing we have to understand.

If that is the case with Avatar, imagine what the sequels will be like. Just imagine. If you can.That's why I'm excited. That's why it's taking so long.

"+SN - Old channel James Cameron has written many more movies than he has directed, and in that sense, he is more of a writer than a director. Even still, it takes longer to make a movie if you are also the writer, and James Cameron decided not to make ""Avatar 2"" until he had also written 3 and 4. Remember, not counting ""Piranha 2"" (which wasn't really his project), James Cameron has only directed 7 films. For a director that has been working since 1978, that is a very short list. The Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, Terminator 2, True Lies, Titanic, and Avatar, that's it, those are all the James Cameron movies in existence. It was 12 years between Titanic and Avatar because he spent most of his time writing and developing technology. We are lucky that we are getting ""Avatar 2"" as early as next year. Also don't forget that he wrote things like ""Rambo: First Blood Part II,"" ""Strange Days,"" and 40 episodes of ""Dark Angel.""ï»¿"

"Though this is an old post,a I think I should correct something here.. Pandoras trees DO make oxygen, and the reason humans cannot breathe the air from Pandoras atmosphere is that some of the other gases in it are toxic to humans. That is why they require the masks.

Not once did I noticed the computer generated animations that were the Navi's, maybe because I suspended my disbelief for three hours.I really don't understand some critics saying the story lacked complexity while critics are covering with gold the ''Gravity'' movie which has less story developpment.

The funny thing is just about every possible template out there has been used many many times, so I don't get why Avatar and the ""white man enters a native culture and becomes the greatest of them"" is so terrible.

"Sure, if you go into specifics, no other film has the exact plot of Avatar.  But if you look at films that came out before Avatar like Dances with Wolves, Ferngully, Atlantis:  The Lost Empire, Pocahontas, and The Last Samurai, they all have the same basic plot.  Just fill in different names and locations, and you got a slightly different movie.  And that's just the main plot.I don't dislike Avatar, but I agree that it is unoriginal.ï»¿"

"This movie was fantastic for the abilities shown of what is possible on the set in todays world. The story was excellent. It was the future pretty much telling you what we did to the Native Americans in the old days. We were greedy fucks who wanted a mineral for its money and expected the Native species to just leave so we could have what was not rightfully ours. Technology means jack shit. Willpower to survive can and has beat Military technology in the past, and present.ï»¿"

this film is so fucking epic.ï»¿
"The situation explained in this movie is the daily bread of my country, just that colonist win and natives are less with each yearï»¿"
"Just to add, if Nolan and Cameron were to make a movie together I imagine the plot would go like this: An elite team of recon marines, scientists, and explorers subconsciously enter into a mystical world in another dimension where an alien race is at war with an army of machine cyborgs. The humans are only there to find an ancient artifact in which the aliens need to survive but after a change of heart, humans decide to help the aliens fight against the tyrannical machines.ï»¿"
"This is my idea of an Epic movie: What if James Cameron and Christopher Nolan were to team up and write a script together and then turn that script into a movie with the two of them directing it together! A movie that's like Avatar, Inception, Terminator 2, The Dark Knight, Aliens, and The Abyss mixed together. That would be a Great movie!!!!ï»¿"

And I think it's a shame because it has good performances, whether cgi or not. It's like Nolan's Batman films, a rare thing to find in typical hollywood blockbusters. I appreciate it because they at least took their time in making it look real. Most movies like this don't even give a shit about that, which is the only thing they got to show. ï»¿"

LOVED this movie! ï»¿
@MAnnaconduit1 Titanic and Avatar are both overrated. They don't come close to being called masterpieces. What most people need to realise is that Cameron's true masterpiece was Terminator 2ï»¿
"I love this movie. It's cool if you guys don't like it, this is just one of my favorite movies. Sure the storyline is repeated and familiar but I personally think that they try and make it different from those movies that use the storyline. ï»¿"

"Omg, yeah thats a great movie :Dï»¿"
there's a sequel on the works? damn... another overrated one again.. to me The Avengers should be the top grosser right now..ï»¿

Nothing can exceed it""ï»¿"
"Their probably is.But say if 5 people liked Men in Black, 5 people liked Avatar and 5 people liked Ice age. Out of the Men in Black,3 people also liked avatar.

"I could'nt agree with you more.. what the hell is up with James Cameron anyway? just because he makes the movies, it instantly makes mega high gross? The Avengers should've broken this movie's record no sweat and made this movie's gross look like shit.. not all movies with great cgi make good money dude.. some movie's spent A LOT of budget but earned WAY LESS than that budget spentï»¿"
i think some movies reuse sound effects. have you ever played the lego game and heared the scream when you kill someone? I've heard that same scream in quite alot of movies.ï»¿

Aren't there 2 more sequels to see the consequences? Besides it made sense that the animals united along with the n'avi. The hard armor of those hammer head shark like beasts were foreshadowed at the start of the movie and therefore it was acceptable.ï»¿

"Besides your clusterfuck of grammar let me point out a few things:You keep assuming this is a sci-fi adaptation of the colonial story like Pocahantas. But it isn't. Cameron has specifically highlighted the issue of multinational corporations ravaging foreign landscapes with no regards to their actions.

"Eh, a good movie but I thought the plot was very simple. Mostly the effects make it a movie worth watching.ï»¿"
"That's because it's directed by James Cameron & he has a huge fanbase. His last feature length movie was Titanic, he had been wanting to make Avatar for 14 years and many people knew it. It was really hyped & had a huge marketing campaign revolving around the technology used in the film. Avatar was released during December with no competition, plus it had 3D which raises ticket prices. The story is not very original, and it's full of cliches and epic action. It had a formula for success. ï»¿"
"Awesome movie, but did anyone else realize that the end of the movie didn't make any sense? Jake stayed to forever live in his avatar body, but max and norm also stayed behind, and neither of them had avatar bodies.

"neo was as much an avatar for the viewer as the blue alien was for jake. jake was a developed character, which makes it harder for the viewer to 'be' jake, even though he was an everyman-type character. i definitely relate more with neos deep-seated motivation to free himself from control, at the cost of disrupting the machines' idea of 'peace.' not to say that avatar's conflict (jake's motivation to 'betray his own race') isnt valid, but i dont agree that matrix was 1-dimensional. its cool thoï»¿"
"Jake is a surrogate character, but he has more realistic motivations and deeper psychological issues than Neo. And if the conflict in Avatar, maybe there's good reason for that. It's certainly done better than George Lucas was ever capable of doing, IMO.ï»¿"
"i know what you're talking about. the impact that losing/regaining the ability to walk had on jake was understated in the movie compared to the script. still, the conflict in the matrix is more gray, and avatar is more black-and-white, to me anyway, despite neo being a little under-developed (although it was on purpose-- neo was a surrogate character, so the ins and outs of the matrix could be easier for the viewer to understand).ï»¿"
"It feels one-dimensional, because his reasons are actually on screen, but at times, it's very subtle in the script.Neo's personality is talked about and talked about and talked about, over and over. There's no subtlety. And Neo's character definitely is not represented visually, nearly as well as Jake's personality in Avatar.Think of Avatar as Star Wars and The Wizard of Oz, made by Orson Welles.ï»¿"

"jakes 'reason' to inherit the alien body permanently was 1-dimensional compared to neos choice. in avatar, its pretty clear that the humans were greedy corporate tyrants who killed earth & would do the same to pandora. in the matrix, humans were allowed to live in harmony with the machines, after mankind killed earth-- but neo couldnt accept living in a cage, & joined the war against the machines. the conflict in the matrix is way more interesting than in avatar (though i like both movies)ï»¿"
"Actually, Worthington actually had better reason to be the way he was than Keanu Reeves as Neo was throughout The Matrix.However, if you've actually seen Reeves in other roles, he's actually a good actor. Need proof? Watch The Gift.Neo was a one-dimensional character, compared to Jake Sully. Of course, I think all of The Matrix characters were pretty hollow, especially in retrospect.But, society turned Jake into a hollow shell of a man, because of the fact that he was paraplegic.ï»¿"
"Well, why don't we ask why Jake seemed more alive in his new body? Because he's getting a second chance at life. He actually gets to walk again, which he probably hasn't been able to do for a while. He's full of life in his Avatar. Outside of his Avatar, he feels like his life is worthless. When everyone with money can afford to fix a crippling problem in the future and Jake can't, he's an outcast, greater than... anyone today. What becomes of someone who is cast out of society? Jake Sullyï»¿"
"I think he means its funny cuz both movies (Avatar and Titanic) are completely different, and they are also are completely different from True Lies and Terminator, Cameron's other films. Cameron is unstoppable, he can do anything he wants at this point. I did research on his films, and Avatar and Titanic and are two highest grossing films OF ALL TIME. He is an amazing film director, my favorite so far. ï»¿"

"Disagree @lionessgirl88. Sam worthington was perfectly cast as Jake Sully - his acting in the Avatar body is actually better. I don't believe they could've picked anyone more suited - not least to be so compatible with Zoe Saldana. For me, it was a perennial film and I'm glad many cuts were made from the original script as it made him seem more like a bozo whilst incorporating a second, albeit pointless love match between Norm and Trudy. Can't wait for the second film, I really hope it's a sequï»¿"

"I actually thought Titanic was overrated. It was well done and had awesome special effects, but it was too ""sappy"" for my taste. I am not a huge fan of Leo Dicaprio either. The only thing I didn't like about Avatar was, once again, the lead actor (Sam Worthington) who played Jake Sully. I thought Cameron could have done better. I think Worthington is too one-dimensional the way Keanu Reeves is. ï»¿"
Yes I agree Dark Knight was overrated except for Heath Ledger's performance which I thought was Oscar worthy (he won best supporting actor Oscar). He was the only good thing about the film! lolï»¿
Why is that funny?ï»¿
"To me, The Dark Knight is overrated. But, Avatar was worth every penny, IMO. Like Titanic.ï»¿"
"Actually, Cameron was going to write his own novelization of the film. As he said, the book would be like the ""Avatar Bible."" BUT, I haven't seen one page or sentence from this book. I can't wait to see what Cameron added to the mythology.ï»¿"

"If all 6.5 billion of us were given an unlimited amt of time to explore every single star in the Universe for life-bearing planets, each human will be given a chart containing 6,153,846,153,846 stars.

Yeah, we've got a big backyard to explore.ï»¿"
"Brilliant movie! It's about time we get another GREAT sci-fi film that takes place elsewhere. I just wish Hollywood would stop portraying sci-fi movies as near-future (100-500 years). For us to advance, travel, and colonize worlds in our own backyard, not including the 200 billion+ galaxies with 200+ billion stars in each galaxy (roughly)...we're talking a timeframe measured in thousands of years into the future, if not tens of thousands or even further. ï»¿"

Tell me something, would you sympathize with the Na'vi if they looked like the Trade Federation aliens from Episode I, or perhaps the classic large brained dark eyed creatures of the 1950s? No, you would be repulsed. And that's were Cameron controls your emotions so that you overlook his loser storyï»¿"
"@zblamm2121 Agreed. I mean, why can't people see the real story of Avatar? Jake Sully is an ex-marine who is paralyzed from the waste down.

"James Cameron's $1 billion sci-fi epic Avatar has been hit by accusations of racism. Critics claims the story of a white US Marine who saves an alien race perpetuates the ""white Messiah fable"" and suggests that non-whites are primitives incapable of helping themselves.Hundreds of blogs, YouTube videos and Twitter postings have sprung up on the subject since the film's release three weeks ago, with one writer dubbing the 3-D extravaganza ""a racial fantasy par excellence"".RIDICULOUSï»¿"

"Ok, i went to see this movie on a small screen cinema, on the front row, in 2D. It is amazing. By far the best film i have ever seen in my life. It is truly breathtaking. It made me feel so many emotions; happiness, sadness, fear, love, anxiety, awe, and literally had me hating my own species. And the special effects ARE revolutionary, and i saw the film in 2D!! I would go further that my favourite film. In my opinion, AVATAR is the best film ever made :)ï»¿"

"I just got back from the theater, and I think there are lots of other interesting things to think about in the movie, more than anyone could expect from older works, like why would they insert a character with disability who is not trained at all in the avatar science as the main character? Why would Jake feel like the Na'vi's way is more real than his life as an earthling? and many more. Even the war in the second half of the movie uses strategies in the Art of War.ï»¿"

i agree it's awesome in the cinema with the surround sound and the 3D makes it that even more amazingï»¿
You have to check with your local Theatre. It was would say 3D beside the name on the listing. If it doesn't say that then they don't offer it at your movie theater.ï»¿

"Saw it today. Great movie. Though, my only hesitation about seeing it again is at the theater we saw it at it was in 3D which was good, but took away alot of the colour. I'll just have to see it in a different one. Ah well. Still, it's a great movie. It really felt like you were experiencing Pandora yourself - Obviously without the flying and dieing and danger.

"The human race is a virus. It gets bigger and bigger every year. If there is a set back we'll come back stronger trying to take over what really isn't ours.

This movie is epic... James Cameron is a friggin genious.ï»¿
All I can say is that this is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in my life. The graphics were amazingly realistic; I felt like I was looking at real footage most of the time. And the story started off a little fast but overall it was incredibly epic. This is one of my new favorite movies. It's totally a must-see. 99/100 stars.ï»¿
"Off the top of my head, I can't recall any fluff that DESPERATELY needed to be cut, but it did seem there was room for more goodness in this movie. But I loved it, awesome movie.

"To be completely honest, this movie was the story of Pocahontas retold with a sci-fi twistThe story was predictable, but its proven to be a solid, easy to follow story in the past. Mix that in with some AMAZING visuals and awesome sci-fi creativity and you have Avatar.ï»¿"

"Looks like a hel of a ride;make a shitload of money;too bad Cameron doesn't do subtlety;I've seen this in ""Dances with Wolves"",Last Samurai"";;ï»¿"
"THAT's a more valid argument, though again, it could be coincidental.ï»¿"
"You've got to be kidding me. You're comparing a director's dream from the 1980's with a game started in 2006/2007. You fail, hard. Avatar takes nothing from Borderlands. You might be right about Halo, but that could be coincidental. As for night-crawler and the Na'vi, the only resemblances are blue skin and tails. Smurfs have tails, too. Was nightcrawler inspired by smurfs? ^^ï»¿"
this movie is sick!!!! i watched it last night and i wanna see it again really badly!ï»¿
i also forgort the robot at 1:20 to 1:25 look like the ones in the matrixï»¿
"smurfs fighting the military.... no seriously people, this movie is brilliant and its in 3d, fucking loved itï»¿"
"this movie looks epic, but, it looks like they took alot of ideas from other stuff. like ""Pandora"" is the name of the planet just like in borderlands. The planes that they fly look alot like the hornets and pelicans in halo. The navee or whatever they are called kinda look like night crawler from x-menï»¿"
"i watched the movie yesterday,is my favourite movie ever!!!ï»¿"
"This looks like  a blue-people version of Pocahontas...i wanna see thisï»¿"

"Please explain to me how we have control over what are global oil prices after forcing Iraq's submission when we never took control of their oil.  Oil Co. make 8.1 cents per gal profit on gas, the Feds make 18.4 cents, here in WA the State makes 28 cents.  The tax & spend politicians are the real thieves and profiteers yet they get on their soapboxes to convince idiots that Big Oil is the enemy.  Now they demonize insurance co. who make a scant 2% profit....but in lib world any profit is evil.ï»¿"
sick!!!!!!!!!ï»¿
"Wow, you are obviously a lost cause, you have learned your leftist propaganda well and can now be proudly considered a true Obamatron.  In one post you say oil has gone up and in the next you say our evil military has aquired Middle Eastern oil for cheap fuel....so which is it idiot?  Since you leftist pukes hate this country and its military so much why don't you get the Hell out?  Canada is a short drive to socialism if you can't afford to go to Europe.ï»¿"
The Na'vi remind me of blue thundercats.ï»¿
Lol to payment argument... largest budget ever. Cameron doesn't care about costï»¿
That's funny how your cutting down a movie you haven't even FUCKING SEEN.ï»¿
"I've just got back from see it, and I loved this film. I dont normally like over CGI'd movies, But the charaters are so believeable and the graphics are visually stunning, like no movie you have seen before!Was a tad too long, but was fast paced and great action. See it in the theatre in 3D its awesome! :)ï»¿"

"If there is a modern example of our military ""invading"" another country for something we want I am unaware of it so maybe you could provide an example.  They fight for our protection, many times their objective is to fight for the rights of people of the country they are in.  I know lefties claim we ""invade"" countries for their oil, but we have never taken a drop of oil from the regimes we have toppled.  I thought the movie was great, just deprogram the kids from the propaganda afterwards.ï»¿"
AWESOME MOVIEï»¿
It is very good...passy(india)ï»¿
"beaconbrands... there's some legitimacy to the whole ""US unfairly invades foreign territory to get what they want"" element of our nation's history. Yes, it's an allegory which provides social commentary on the moral legitimacy of America's military agendas. that doesn't make it propaganda. And since James Cameron is an incredibly epic filmmaker and storyteller, that doesn't make it scum either.ï»¿"
awesome!!! great visuals and a great storyï»¿
"the best the best the best I love this movie I saw it in Thursday night and in Friday WOW....ï»¿"
"Every single dollar you spend to watch this movie, goes into the pocket of NewsCorp, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, the owner of FoxNews, the channel used by Bill O'reilly and Glenn Beck to spew hatred and racism. Think about that, guys!!!ï»¿"
Saw this yesterday at 10. movie ended at 12:45. Saw it in 3D IMAX. One of the best movies ive seen in awhile. Full of action too. A must watch movie.ï»¿
just got tickets to see this in IMAX...gonna be fucking awesomeï»¿
good movie.ï»¿
"Apparently you didn't see the movie loser, I did.  The actual plot of the movie was the evil corp. coming in to take the resources of the indigenous people who are one with their nature god, just like leftist.  The evil military was there to force these people to give up their resources if negotiations failed and of course those evil military people were more than happy to kill for the almighty capitalist dollar.  So this was a typical left-wing propaganda movie even though it was impressive.ï»¿"
like what is happening on our planet every day.ï»¿
"Nope cause they dnt win, so they dnt take over the land!!ï»¿"

It's amazing you act like you know what you're talking about. You're dissing employee's to a business. When you should be looking at the business itself. Do you fault the cashier at McDonald's for its unhealthy menu too? Your logic is putrid.ï»¿
"Some people join the forces because there are no other careers where they grew up, or some are rightly or wrongly patriotic, unless you've served or have family who have served then dont go throwing around frankly disgusting words like ""parasites"" because you know fuck all.

"I'm going to end this conversation on two accounts. One, this is a dumb place to do it, and two you are obviously insane, and convincing you that you are no less and no more human than I is impossible because you have lost all aspects of sanity.And on another note, you can go fuck yourself you low-life prick. Fuck you for dissing our men and women and service, and fuck you for being insane. And fuck Sci-Fi channel, the cheesiest shit movies I've ever seen. You watch too much of it.ï»¿"
"another movie showing just how savage whites really are..take someones land, and their natural resources kill and rape their people and destroy and steal the culture.boringï»¿"

seen it 2 times in 1 day. Opening night at midnight not in 3D. Just got back from a 3D one. OMG 3D IS!!! FUCKING AMAZING! A MUST SEE!ï»¿
The best part:THIS! THIS IS OUR LAND!ï»¿
"THIS IS A MUST SEE, 3D IS PHENOMENALï»¿"
Must watch in 3D. It is way worth the effects. It is absolutely mind blowing how significant the 3D visual effects are. JUst watched it an hour ago. Enjoy.ï»¿
incredible movieï»¿
"OMG WHAT A MOVIE , CANT WAIT TO GET IT ON BLU RAY .. WATCH IT IN THEATRES   10/10   BEST MOVIE SINCE THE PAST 5 years. I HAVE SEEN .ï»¿"
Saw it earlier today! IT WAS AWESOME! I cant even explain how good that was!ï»¿
Great Fuckin MOVIE. All the way THROUGH.ï»¿
"This movie has the best visual effects in film history, in my opinion; however, LOTR: Return of the King is still my favorite, most memorable movie.ï»¿"
Avatar is actually a name something related to reincarnation in Hinduism religion..If I'm correct.....ï»¿
BEST MOVIE OF 2009ï»¿
"Best movie i ever seen yet.loved it!ï»¿"
"I found myself falling asleep during parts of this movie.  And you're always confused about who you should be sympathizing with.  It's so boring and drug out.  The fight scenes really don't come til the end, and it's not something that just keeps you on the edge of your seat.  It's all pretty simple and bland.  And yes, I did see it in 3D.  I would not recommend this movie.  It's long, boring, and costs way too much money for 3D.  See the regular version if you have to.ï»¿"
It was a lot better than I thought it was going to be.  It has good lessons told in a really interesting way.ï»¿
"I seriously don't get the hype about the special effects. Lots of stuff going on, and lots of detail, but it doesn't look any better than anything else out there with a decent budget. The giant smurfs look fake and their voices don't match (yeah I know about the invented language and all). The effects of LOTR, for instance, were more more real-feeling.ï»¿"
This movie was incredible... seriously amazing!ï»¿
"Looks like a futuristic story about the same thing that happened to the American Indians. They lived in peace until the white man who couldn't see past his billfold arrived, and wanted everything.ï»¿"
"Just went and seen the 3-D version with my wife tonight, AWSOME!! Definitely see it in 3-D, effects are incredible!ï»¿"
one of the best sci-fi movies ever. some gay rights people are protesting this movie because of hetrosexuality. they should protest twilight this is an actually good movie i would give it 11/10ï»¿
NO!!!! ITS AWESOME!!!!ï»¿
haha not really. there's so much more to feel than this 2D trailer.ï»¿
SUPERB PRODUCTION! totally worth a second watch.ï»¿
"I saw it tonight, and i left breathless. Worth the money and time.ï»¿"
lol saw this 2:50 pm today. not alot of people in the theatre which i was surprised about. this movie was awesomeï»¿
i.... liked itï»¿
seriously....how does this look anything like Pocahontas? xDDDï»¿
Saw it today!!! BEST MOVIE IN A LONG TIME!!!! -and the most expenseive one eva! :)-ï»¿
if you gonna go watch this movie watch it in 3d! with them 3-d glasses wow!!! simply amazing.ï»¿
"My old favorite movie USES to be Saving Priveate Ryan.....Not anymore hahaSaw this at the midnight opening in Cali. Absolutely INCREDIBLE film.ï»¿"
"Follow me on Twitter @MechanicalDumby I follow back :)Im about to see AVATARï»¿"
"2/5 in 3D.  It just gave me a headache that I still have 4 hours after the showing ended.  It's alright, but way too long.  And it's really hard to follow because you become so tired of watching.  If you plan on watching, just watch the normal version.  Not the 3D.  You'll regret it.ï»¿"
Why expose the rest of us to all of this profanity?  Maybe you should stop suckling yourself and grow up.ï»¿
"loved the movie, cant wait to see it on the new LG led on 3-d blu ray. that will be mind blowing!ï»¿"
Light on story?  What are those critics who say that talking about?  That sounds like the discomfort talking. Maybe this story forces them to face how indigenous people have been treated.  Apparently James Cameron has a lot to say.  After seeing this trailer I definitely plan to see this movie.ï»¿
i loved it.will buy the movie when it comes out.ï»¿
"It amazes me how people can make such vast assumptions about the meaning of communism without any reflection whatsoever that watching the movie for free (in order to sidestep the capitalist agenda to exploit people who labor for a pittance) is a communist practice. That's right, communism is a practice, not a belief system. If you are watching the movie for free, you are a practicing communist. Wake up. Have some integrity.ï»¿"
I just saw the movie and it was amazing. I loved the CG in it as well as the acting and storyline. The movie was by far one of the best movies ive ever seen.ï»¿
This was the most expensive movie ever made. Also the best movie ever made. BY FAR THE BEST! God bless James Cameron!ï»¿
I Loved it. It is now my favorite movie.ï»¿
"this movie was amazing, the story wasgrea, but very simple. i thought it was one of the best movies i saw in a while!!ï»¿"
i mean 500 million dollarsï»¿
"only 500,000 dollarsï»¿"
"I saw this in IMAX 3D and it changed my life. The most visually impressive thing I have ever seen.sure it has major cliche elements. yes you have seen these plot devices before... you've just never seen it blow your mind like this.ï»¿"

Our public school system has gone from a system designed to educate our kids to a system that intentionally dumbs down and propagandizes them so they will not question their political masters.  I am truly sorry that you are apparently not receiving the education that you deserve.

"Marx was a brilliant, smart and well intentioned man. His idea just didn't work!However, I do have to say, certain aspects of socialism need to be implemented. The corperations and the banks need to basically have their power taken away, but not their standard of living.I have come up with a system where we take the progressive tax BACK to the extreme and tax the super rich. On the flip side, we should remove some taxes on the lower class. Class struggles are persistent today...ï»¿"

"""It's been proven through quantum mechanics that the energy/conciousness that existed at the beginning of time aka GOD is still a part of everything in the universe at the smallest measurable level.""============ Did your therapist tell you that BS?  IMO God is a separate force and I did not mean that God created nature to impress us, his work just happens to be so impressive that it makes his greatness obvious and undeniable as only God could create such beauty and complexity.ï»¿"
"Actually it's been proven through quantum mechanics that the energy/conciousness that existed at the beginning of time aka GOD is still a part of everything in the universe at the smallest measurable level. So yes God is a part of everything including nature. Otherwise what is He/She/It? Some kind of separate force that chills outside of the cosmos somewhere? A God that needs people to recognize His greatness through spectacular shows is not God, but rather an insecure human.ï»¿"

"Through your sarcasm you unintentionally hit on the truth.  No God is not part of nature, God created nature and animals for man, through them we see his greatness.  And no I do not think God is a republican, but most republicans, that is conservatives, love and believe in the real God and do their best to follow his teachings and word.  Libs on the other hand are part of the new age Sodom & Gomorrah with their baby killing along with pushing the disgusting immorality of their gay agenda.ï»¿"

"If you took the time to read my post you could avoid looking like an idiot.  I never said Hollywood was capitalist, they hate capitalism, they merely use it as a vehicle to make the money they need to spread their pro-socialist propaganda.  Michael Moore was confronted on this issue where it was pointed out to him that he has achieved fame and wealth using capitalism while then condemning the very vehicle by which he succeeded.  He glumly had to agree with that assessment.ï»¿"
"Is this not a perfect example of Marx's central diving agent of change? Namely the tension/contradiction between the forces of production and exploitative relations of production?

"Have you ever studied communism?  Or are you just going by what you hear on the news?  I think the latter.  Saying someone is a capitlaist, and a communist is like saying someone is black, and then white.  Figure out what you are talking about first.ï»¿"

"You're right, Hollywood does use capitalism to make it's money, but the people who run and act in Hollywood are far-left commies and socialist who thrive under capitalism, but then use their money and medium to spread their anti-capitalist pro-socialist agenda.  Michael Moore is a perfect example of that.  Communism isn't working for the common good, it is slavery and the redistribution of wealth from those who earn money to the lazy welfare left who demand their handout.ï»¿"
"Why is ""Marx"" always used in a negative light?  Have you ever studied communism?  Have you ever studied anything?  I find that people who don't know anything are the first ones to point out the ""Marxist"" propoganda.  We're not in the Cold War anymore people.ï»¿"

"I just watched this movie in 3D this morning and it was really cool.  Of course when watching this movie you have to block out the obvious leftist propaganda it touts like:  Military bad, Corporation & capitalism bad, Humans bad, Tree hugging indigenous people good and of course the real God is replaced with the liberal god of nature/earth.

Only by actually seeing it where it lies, in each of us, is it possible to reduce using race to justify maintaining the power structure that favors the already privileged at the expense of those who remain marginalized.

"I saw this movie at a special screening last night. I was naturally skeptical going in, as I do not prefer effect-heavy films usually. This movie was a nice surprise. Everything was fluid and seemingly real. The film is obviously long, running approximately 2 1/2 hours, but the time goes by quickly. It's Cameron's best film besides Terminator 2. The political commentary is rather ''in your face,'' but if you go into it with the mind of having fun, you won't be disappointed. 4/5ï»¿"

"Good I'm glad people are making movies like this. More than 97% of native american ""prisoners"" when ""rescued"" by white settlers either went back to the tribes or wished they had. Children ""Prisoners"" cried and screamed and wanted to stay, the natives would give very few back, and if they did they'd stay in touch. Native women who bore half white children were looked at the same as any full blood to the tribe, but the whites didn't bother going back for those kids because they were half breeds.ï»¿"

"Oh no, not more cgi laden crap...geez..! Gone are the days when things could be believeable. Real actors doing real things..not all this computer generate superhuman crap. Aliens was fantastic but this...I ain't gonna waste my pennies seeing. Looks rubbish.ï»¿"
"Why didn't you like Titanic? I mean I'm not saying I'm a big fan of it or anything, I have some problems with it myself, I'm just asking what your own reasons are.ï»¿"
*Shakes head* Not good. In so many ways.ï»¿
but the movie is of foxï»¿
looks awsome.............! Divine creation lolï»¿
i need to see this...ï»¿
reminds me of halo...so freakin' sweet...i love the beggining of the trailer...ï»¿
I don't know... I don't thik this movie is going to be as good as all the people expect...ï»¿
Another waste of money to promote US foreign policy. What a load of shite. James Cameron this ones a doozy!ï»¿
"Movie finally premiered last night in London, and ended with the audience in claps and cheers. First reviews can attest to that. Pretty much all of 'em agree that it's a complete spectacle and that the King (as in, James Cameron) is indeed back. All I can say from that is the following: SUCK IT, HATERS!!!!ï»¿"
Typical Americans - find a peaceful place and destroy it with money orientated means.ï»¿
Looks like a good movie. The anaology with the treatment of the Native Americans in the United States; the Aborigines in Australia or just about any indigenous people who stand in the way of 'economic progress' is pretty clear and I hope that people who see this movie understand the link.ï»¿
looks goodï»¿
"THE NAVI CONCEPT IS SO NOT-ORIGINAL!!!!!!!!!!!(who played FFX or FFX-2 wil understand)ï»¿"
then start from yourself.ï»¿
"earlsfav, people have the right to have their own opinions even if they don't agree with yours. I don't see anything mind blowing about it......conquest of the Amazons but in another planet.  I sure hope that the film is far better than the trailer.ï»¿"
This is one of the movies where its politically incorrect to say anything about them.  All I see is humans fighting blue people in an Amazon like planet. In the end the good guys win. End of story.ï»¿
"I still dont get the fuss...the Avatar beings look cartoonish...something out of Star Wars.The only thing worth seeing IMO is the landscapes and the background.ï»¿"

this is like a playstation game without the controllers.ï»¿
"lmao. good call. its Kimari!ï»¿"
I can't wait to see it. I have a real aliens feel for it alreadyï»¿
I have a lot of confidence in Cameron and his team. I hope this one is full of fresh effects and action scenes. Looks like he has a chance to do some stuff with the eco message and maybe some transhumanism stuff. I think it'll do wellï»¿
ur stupid this is one of the most expensive movies made. thieve spent so much money on this spent so much time making it so if you dont like it than dont watch videos of and dont comment on it.ï»¿
looks like a great movieï»¿

"Looks beautiful. Dialogue, however, sounds laughable, almost like a parody.ï»¿"

Luv the previews. I'll watch it and buy the DVD.ï»¿
great movieï»¿
"Imagine if China with so much people start to take over other countries.  Those countries would fight to the death to defend it.  U.S.A will defend its territories and countries from hostile take overs.  If Russia said we have 10 trillion dollars for Alaska to buy it back since you're already in debt, would it sell out?  Typical strong countries taking over other countries who know nothing about guns and bullets or bombs.ï»¿"
yay - SIGOURNEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ï»¿
Soooo this film is Dances with Wolves set in the future and the native americans are blueï»¿
You're such an idiot. The movie is protrayed as soldiers invading someone's homeland and telling them to get lost so we can take it. Wouldn't you be pissed and hateful to them if they were destroying your home. Besides he got his legs with the avatar and as you can see he fights with them.ï»¿
"Why do the Avatar people hate the Americans? They are just trying to bring them into the 21st Century. They are trying to get that soldiers legs back, that was the deal. So let them, why not?ï»¿"
"Let me guess......humans,military and indstry are the bad-guy?.......wow what a tired movie line..........ï»¿"

"The special effects are goodLet's see if the movie and the story are that goodï»¿"
"Yup this has pretty much the same idea but D9 had less ""bling"", propaganda and massive battles which was a good change IMO. Let's just hope that this is as cool : )ï»¿"
lool music by steve jablonsky???ï»¿
looks kinda like district nine?ï»¿
sounds like every game from a movie.ï»¿
"i cant wait to c thismy video production class will be taking a field trip on december 18 opening day to the movie theater to c this movie and i cant waitafter watchin the trailer cant waiti will be missing 4 of my classes to c this so YAY!ï»¿"
so what? most games based on movies get low ratings. Doesn't mean that this movie will suck because the game did.ï»¿
lmfao. classic.ï»¿
"it has a game in demo not released yet, youtube itï»¿"
why would any one list true lies as one of they're works?ï»¿

I don't think I've ever been so excited about an upcoming movie.ï»¿
Beutifull colors is going to look great on blueray.ï»¿
pg13 i thinkï»¿
wut rate is it?ï»¿
I will try to be optimistic. Titanic trailer was also a dud.ï»¿
"I'll pass on this...being a Cameron fan, I am disappointed by the overuse of CGI...it looks like a video game!ï»¿"
Kinda has a Pocahontas feel to itï»¿

"FAIL,  you spelled fail wrongï»¿"
This movie gonna be a bomb!!! Just magical!!! Somehow I'm speechless after watching this trailer and it doesn't stop! :)ï»¿

"yea i know, im saying just for the movie, and on 60 Minutes Cameron was on and they said it was $400+ all together not 500ï»¿"
lolwutï»¿
Looks like a computer game because you are not seeing it as its meant to be seen in 3D. Just wait. It's visually stunning in a way that no film has ever been.ï»¿
Yeah based on a real True storyï»¿
fantastic technology but why create a film that looks like a computer game crossed with a crap army story...waste of money and timeï»¿
lookin goodï»¿

It's not what the story's about it's about how it's told. Roger Ebert said something like that. And it holds true. James Cameron hasn't failed in career w/ his films. So hopefully this works too.ï»¿
