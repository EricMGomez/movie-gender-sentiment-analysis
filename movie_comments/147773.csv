s a d d e r d a z e I found a physical copy of this movie at a dollar store. My heart literally stopped and I literally ran to the checkout to buy itï»¿
good movie !! i'd recommend...sam rockwell was mvpï»¿
I wasn't expecting this movie to be so goodï»¿
Sam Rockwell Making everyones lifes easier awwï»¿
Just watch it. Simply Amazingï»¿
I was on a flight home from Florida when this popped up in the airport a year after this movie came out. I downloaded it and loved it so much. Probably one of my favorite movies ever.ï»¿
"In the very last ending scene, at the very last second he looked like he was about to cryï»¿"
"What do they do there, no wonder why everyone thought theyâ€™re insane anymore...ï»¿"
Najlepszy film na Å›wiecie <3ï»¿
This movie was a nice surprise.ï»¿
Am I the only one who is gonna notice that they have tubes instead of the mats now lolï»¿
"Damn just watched it, awesome movieï»¿"

This is one of those sneak under the radar movies that was well done.  Liked it very much.ï»¿
Whatâ€™s the song at like 50-55 secondsï»¿
Loved this movie. Sam Rockwell as always was Amazing.ï»¿
UNDERRATEDï»¿
I thought I would give this movie a go when it came on FILM4 and I really enjoyed it.  But if I had seen this trailer first I probably would have skipped it.  What a terrible trailer!ï»¿
Watched this movie a hundred times and it never get old _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
"I remember in 2013, I ended up watching this movie by myself by mistake because i wanted to watch this horror movie but I was the only one underage among my group of friends. It was good ngl.ï»¿"
One of my favorite movies everï»¿
In a time when the world was full of beautiful people... Now everyone is on their phones and computers. Until they get depressed because they have no real friends or real purpose. And then they want to shoot you at the mall. What the f*$@ happened?ï»¿
"Seriously though, he is a 3, Michael Scott is correct.ï»¿"
one of my favorite movies ever. I could watch this movie a million times. So well done and acted.ï»¿
I've heard this is a great movie.ï»¿
I cannot put into words how much I love this movie.ï»¿
one of my fave movies!ï»¿
Steve Carrell was such a douche in this film.ï»¿
I canâ€™t believe this movie is 5 years old.ï»¿
Two Oscar Winning actors in this movie!!! ~ Yours Truly Skooledï»¿
"Best movie but the end is sad , i want the way way back 2 with happy endï»¿"
"And now sam and allison winning an Oscar, especially sam he so fckn talentedï»¿"

"He kinda looks like Dexter, from the backï»¿"
"I freaking love love this movie. Anytime Iâ€™m feeling down, I watch this and it makes me feel better. What a great flickï»¿"

"amazing movie, totally took me to back to my awkward high school years #relatableï»¿"
"This film is special, so much heart. Amazing.ï»¿"
First movie I saw Sam Rockwell in and fell in love with him as an actor. I was so proud when he received the Emmy Award recently as if I knew him personally. Congrats Sam-keep rockin on with ure incredible talent!ï»¿
I loved the trailer when it first came out. Bought it with out watching it. Love it ever time I watch it.ï»¿
I am in love with AnnaSophia Robbï»¿
She is beautiful.ï»¿
This trailer gives no justice to the film. Its amazing.ï»¿

"1:00 - the ""hold it"" girl. Anyone know her name?ï»¿"
this boy just reminds me about someone I know - his mannerismsï»¿
its boring dramaï»¿
This trailer sucks. The movie is one of my favoritesï»¿
Genuinely loved this movie.ï»¿
great movieï»¿
Such an amazing movie!ï»¿
The Perks of Being a Wallflower should be in top 3ï»¿
"Such an underrated movie, saw this in the theater. These are the types of films Hollywood just doesn't put a lot of effort into anymore. Wish it was on Netflix but looks like I'll have to get the DVD.ï»¿"
It's areally good movieï»¿
"I remember watching this when i was about 10 and it made me cry, it felt like one of the saddesr movies i had ever watched, the whole mood of the movie is bleak and sad and even though i didn't understand it it made me cry, it made me think of my dad who had passed away and just made me so goddamn sad as a lil 10 year old girlï»¿"
This has been my favorite movie for 4 years nowï»¿
"i didn't expect to love this movie as much as i did! really good watch.ï»¿"
"Wow after reading the comments here, I can't waittt to see this movie! Also: how interesting that steve carrell is the douchey boyfriend LOLï»¿"
I can't believe how hot Steve Carell looks in this film...ï»¿
You mean Sam Rockwell*ï»¿
I had tears in my eyes at the end of the film. Doesn't happen often with me. Great story. Great actors. Great film.ï»¿
"The movie was great, but why am I left with the feeling of... wanting something more? :/ï»¿"
"This is a great little film. You really get sucked into the characters and their different quirks and by the end you think you know what is going to happen, and it sort of does, but not in the way you expect. Def worth seeing.ï»¿"
Another loser white boy makes good movie. At least he's not gay like moonlight.ï»¿
"I cried so much with this movie, it was beautifulï»¿"
one of my fav films. just beautiful.ï»¿
What a great movie.ï»¿
ONE OF THE BEST FILMS IVE WATCHED!!!!!!ï»¿

"Movie was pretty good, gave me the feels!ï»¿"
I didn't know that it could make me cry.ï»¿
"Man, this trailer doesn't do this awesome movie justice.ï»¿"
seriously everyone needs to watch this awesome movie already! It's one of the best comedy with a lot of love!  Sam Rockwell is super good in this movie!ï»¿
An absolutely Incredible Movie. Don't think I've seen characters so developed as these in any other movie.ï»¿
What is it that you guys find so great about this movie? I thought it was really badï»¿

"just finished watching , i criedï»¿"
SHAWN SPENCERï»¿
1:30 music?ï»¿
MY FAVOURITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!ï»¿
I'm not going to the cinema anymore.ï»¿
god that lead killed it. he looks so uncomfortableï»¿
this is such a great movie!!!! if your wondering on watching it or not definitely doï»¿
"This movie is so great, my dad and I watch it every time it is on and It never gets oldï»¿"
this movie was fantasticï»¿
"Really great movie. I actually almost cried at one point, it was just so real. Loved it.ï»¿"
Everyone's commenting about how good Steve Carell and Sam Rockwell did in this movie but no one's commenting about how good the lead player was. He really got into the character. So lonely and uncomfortable and quiet. Exactly what it's like to be a teen on vacation with people whom you don't like and being treated like a little baby. Very underrated! One of my favorite coming of age stories.ï»¿
"Ikr, BTW the lead player was a little, shawn on a show called psychï»¿"
xPROneox GT what?!?! I had no idea!!! I love psych!! _Ÿ˜Åï»¿
"Dear god, that kid looks SOOO uncomfortable. Maybe he's the new Michael Cera actor of uncomfortability instead of awkward dorkness.ï»¿"
That's literally his character.ï»¿
0:37  mmmmmï»¿
"Absolutely love this movie, one of the best coming of age stories.ï»¿"
had me in tears because this reminded me of my childhood except it was my real dad.ï»¿
great movieï»¿
Awesome movie !ï»¿
story of my life lol.ï»¿
I cried a lotï»¿
"This film is amazing, one of my favourties, Sam Rockwell's best ever performance?ï»¿"
i cried when i saw this movieï»¿
One of the very few movies i viewed multiple times.ï»¿
This movie is a story of my lifeï»¿
Is this gonna break my heart again by killing the girl halfway throughï»¿
No lolï»¿
sanderflop nope. nobody diesï»¿
not Bridge to Terabithia hahahaï»¿
No this isn't bridge to terabithia even though it is Annasophia robbï»¿

Santino Sullivan Amaya. Go Where the love isï»¿
There was absolutely nothing on the tv last night.Flicked through and caught this 10 mins in.So glad I gave it a go.A gem of a movie. Good for the soul.ï»¿
Am I the only one who thinks Duncan looks like jake bugg?ï»¿
nopeï»¿
I thought he looked like Shawn Mendes.ï»¿
sweet movieï»¿
the message of this movie was incredibly simple but important: surround yourself with good people.ï»¿
Sometimes your own family is a bad peopleï»¿
"I,love this movieï»¿"
Damn 3 years ago I pass this movie at AMC thinking it was going to be a stupid comedy. The day it came out I watched it and I cried during the movie at least 3 times. I will never forgive myself for not buying a movie ticket to see this in theaters one of my favorite films.ï»¿
Sam Rockwell was outstanding in this film.ï»¿
One of the most overlooked actors everï»¿
"Sam Rockwell was really good! So was Steve Carell, i hated him so much in this movie.ï»¿"
that means he did his job well ;Pï»¿
Absolutely.ï»¿
Sam rockwell is one of the most unappreciated actors in historyï»¿
This movie is a) SO UNDERRATED b) way more than some typical love story c) a true work of artï»¿
This trailer litterally  shows the plot and everything intresting so by watching this trailer you don't need to watch the actual movieï»¿
This movie will become a instant favorite!   It will take you back to those Fourths and Summer Loves that where all so good and you never wanted them to end!  Peace!ï»¿
"Great movie, simple story, just fantacticï»¿"
"Stuck In Love, Perks of Being A Wallflower, The Way Way Back <3 <3ï»¿"
one of the best movies I have ever watched in years which was very connectingï»¿
i finished this movie about five minutes ago and it became one if my faves. i really relate to duncan and suzanna so much you dont even know. duncan's also in my age. ITS SO RELATABLE IT HURTS. its actually one of the few movies where i see myself with the main character. Their family problems are painful ti watch i cries two times. so far the best sundance film ive watched. love love loveï»¿
oh gosh my spelling errors are so cringey i cantï»¿
this along with Perks of being a wallflower are my favorite movies now.ï»¿

"@Jordie Vuitton Little Miss Sunshine, Juno, Begin Again, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, The Skeleton Twins, Enough Said, Sunshine Cleaning, Whip It, and one of my all time favorites is Midnight in Paris, although it is less like this movie than the others. Hope this helped!ï»¿"
@Jordie Vuitton dan in real lifeï»¿
"@Jordie Vuitton if you mean coming of age, summer nostalgic movies, you can't get better than the old classic ""Stand by me""ï»¿"
"any movies like this on? i've already watchs perks of being a wallflower, adventureland, art of getting by, its kind of a funny story and kings of summer.ï»¿"
@yvetal zaher watch The king of summer :)ï»¿

"@Divine Faith Adventureland is really good, rated R but same synopsis as this movie.ï»¿"
"This one and the movie ""The kings of summer"" were the best! You can relate to those movies, and u also want to be put in those situations or just try to solve your problems like this.Any other suggestions for movies similar to this?Â I even watched ""perks of being a wallflower"" for like 12 minutes but i didn't like it.Btw i would recommend ""project almanac"" it's sci-fi but pretty similar to those in particular ways.ï»¿"
"Thank u, i'll watch it :) @Illusive manÂ ï»¿"
"+Random â€˜All Random Clipsâ€™ Videos SWEDEN  i would suggest ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and ""Stuck in Love"" :)ï»¿"
Thank you man i will :)ï»¿
"This movie is on HBO now. It was filmed in Onset Beach. My wife and i spent a lot of time down Onset Beach when we were young. Steve Carrell was one of her favorite actors. She would have loved seeing him play a bad guy. Sadly, she died less than a week before it was shown on HBO. I always watch it and think of her.ï»¿"
Even worse. My wife`s name was Pam.ï»¿
I just finished watching this and it was so great!ï»¿
Thr trailer made me tear up. Really can't wait to watch the movie. ï»¿

I already saw this movie is on of my favorite in one part i cried :) Â  Â  but is very fun and sad.ï»¿
"This trailer doesn't do the movie any justice. It actually makes it look terrible, but it's really good...ï»¿"
I know I didn't watch this movie in theaters because the trailer looked awful stupid 14 year old meï»¿
Amazing movie! Kid looks like zombieland guy's little brotherï»¿
Great indie film(:ï»¿
"This is literally one of the best movies I've ever seen. WATCH IT, I promise you'll love it!ï»¿"
I love this movie and water wizz is a real place there is 2 of themï»¿
"Esta pelicula fue muuy buena!! A mi me encanto, tiene partes tristes y graciosas. Simplemente grendiosa <3ï»¿"
"This movie was really good. Great lines, great script; I was surprised it's not adapted from a book. The setting and even the title sounds like it's from a book. I don't know what I was expecting but the movie made me feel really warm and fuzzy and I find myself wanting to wish the characters the best of luck at the end and hope they will be happy in life.ï»¿"
"Jim Rash wrote it, he's written other screen plays and won an oscar for one of them, he really is talented. I loved this film too all the warm fuzzies happening.ï»¿"
I have seen this movie about 7 times and i can't get over it. This is the best movie i have ever seenâù_ï»¿
Lovely movie and lovely nice guy in head rolle !!!ï»¿
"That's my home town...the water park is Water Wizz in Wareham, MA and most of the actors are from MA.ï»¿"
I've watched this movie twice and just got done watching it right now. It's an amazing movie. I kinda feel like that kid(dunkin) or how ever you spell the name. There's a sad part and some funny parts. Everyone was good at acting and of course Steve correll acts good as the bad guy. I hate bad guys. But anyways this is one of my top best no action movies. I really wish there is a 2nd one but I doubt it.ï»¿
"This is the My Girl of its generation but with a much more pre-teen, teenage nuance that can speak to such a broad range of ""kids"" who don't know that they need a role model, or in their terms ""someone they can relate to"".ï»¿"
"on another level, shows how parents that get divorced do so much damage to their kids......for the sake of being selfish and not considering their kids feelings.Â  The kids (and Owen) in this movie 'get it' and the parents are like immature teens.Â  Really well done movie!ï»¿"
Need other movies like this and It's Kind of a Funny Story.. Any suggestions?ï»¿

"@Osho SArAFÂ Thanks, but I've seen just about every movie with Emma Roberts in it.ï»¿"
"The Spectacular NowPerks of Being a Wallflower ï»¿"
"Just saw this movie on HBO. I love it, I knew Jim Rash from Community and Sam Rockwell is always awesome but i hadn't give myself the time to watch it. It's a wonderful film. Great job from Rockwell channeling Bill Murray in Meatballs, I don't know if that's actually the case, but in my opinion it must be. It was great.ï»¿"
Can you suggest me other movie like that Â ?Â I honestly didn't expect this movie was so wowï»¿
Great movie!ï»¿
"I love Owen so freaking much!!! â™¥ And... yeah, this movie too... :Pï»¿"
I honestly didnt expect this to be one of my favorite movies of all timeï»¿
If u think so I respect but I don't understand why you wouldï»¿
"@Gross GamesÂ Bro, dont you understand the meaning of this movie?I mean almost every child has live throught this shit, maybe not you or your friends, but there is always that one child in your school that has to live like this.His mother could not leave the man, because she want the best for her son, education, school, carrier, work, all that stuff, that is why she stay with him, for her son, if she leave the man. Then she would have the money for her son to go through school and stuff like that.But the son doesn't like the step-father, but he has to live and keep fighting for what he believe.When he grown up and have good work, he can live his truth live!You get it now? It is not the movie, but rather the meaning of the movie itself, every movie have that.ï»¿"
"@Gross GamesÂ Lmao, depressed people are a thing. Especially kids in a situation they can't change. It's a hopelessness and constant anxiety.ï»¿"
"Of course they can change, why would you think they cant change?They are children, event if they are adult, you still can change if you give them time to discover themselfï»¿"
"@Sun SriubonÂ "" In a situation they can't change""As in, he couldn't make his mother dump Trent, it was up to her, and having no control over something like that makes a person feel hopeless; especially a kid. That's what I was getting at.Â ï»¿"
Damm i want to get you ;)ï»¿
"@Matthew Ramos when the movie ended i thought exactly the same thing! But i think there is more to it than what you described above. I believe it was about the importance of surrounding yourself with the right people, the people that can make you happy and can change you in wonderful ways, and how much of an impact it can have on your life. It was a great movie!!ï»¿"
"SAmE, I even wrote a essay about it for school a week after I saw it for a favorite movie promptï»¿"
"yeah right, it really got you when you are in the same situation :')ï»¿"
Hands down the best movie I have ever seen. My favorite movie too!ï»¿
"Great movie! The ending teared me up a bit, its such a beautiful movie. Totally recommend it!ï»¿"

This was an awesome movie! So glad I decided to watch it.ï»¿
just watched it yesterday...amazing movie..i really liked it...i am also looking forward to watching more movies like this..any suggestions?ï»¿
The relationship between Sam Rockwell's character and Liam James' character is one of the coolest ones I've seen in film. Both actors knocked it out of the park.ï»¿
pun intended?ï»¿
Why do I think this is a great movie I'll never know. It felt like reading a good book after the movie ends. weird.ï»¿
"Saw this trailer a year ago, and thought: I have to see this one xd and now i found it again... brb dowload :)ï»¿"
"The BEST movie I have seen in the last year, hands down. A great coming of age storyï»¿"
"THIS MOVIE ALMOST MADE ME CRY, HAHA.ï»¿"
"This is the 5th seemingly great movie I found, in a row, that has not had any form of commerce (nor movie theatre appearences) in the netherlands. I hate how we only do 3D movies nowadays... missing out on this good stuffï»¿"
what a sickly movie. i will be evacuating this page nowï»¿
Best movie everï»¿
agree a great storyï»¿
Comedy/Familyï»¿
Great clean cut family movie! Sam Rockwell is real cool as always! Nice summertime beach atmosphere in the movie!ï»¿
I like it but I hate Steve Carell in this he's an assholeï»¿
That's the point lolï»¿
I'm still trying to figure out why it's called the way way backï»¿
"Duncan always sat in the very back of the car and was a wallflower that tried to stay out of crowds, near the back. It can also mean something that's missed; like people's opportunity to know him(Duncan).With the car thing, as opposed to the back, where his step-sister sits, he's in the way back. So... just a fun title in that respect.ï»¿"
Can anyone give movies that give the same feel as this?ï»¿
"The Kings of Summer, Mud.ï»¿"
Try 'In Her Shoes.'ï»¿
This movie is so important. ï»¿
"I don't know why but everytime I was looking for a film to watch this one came up, at first I didn't feel like it, but I did decide to watch last night, I higly recommend it. Very refreshing, and Sam Rockwell was awesome in this!ï»¿"
i liked everything about the movie except the ending. i thought the mom was going to let the boy stay at the water park. i also thought the mom was going to dump her boyfriend n live wit her son at the waterparkï»¿
Awww. I don't like seeing Steve Carell as a mean guy. lolÂ ï»¿
Great movie!!! Really charming and witty!!!!ï»¿
"A 3? Despite it's just a movie script, he's a cutie!ï»¿"
Why does such a good movie such a bad ending? I mean I might be wrong here and I didnt understand it maybe? .. But I kind of expected more.. Dissapointedï»¿
"What about it did you think was bad? SPOILERS: Ultimately Duncan gained faith in himself via a decent male role model (something he sorely lacked). The mother also realised what she was sacrificing to be with the asshole - I think it's implied that the couple won't remain together. I guess it could have been more fairytale (Duncan staying at the park with Owen, or something) but he's fourteen and it's made quite clear that he has his own life to live.Â Â Â ï»¿"
"@bassben04Â yeah sure, but how you said, they only IMPLIED taht they wont remain together.. And also it was kind of weird that the girl only kissed Duncan and then he left, I expected more, idk I thought they will be together in the end thats all... The ending was just a little bit too open for me :) But nevertheless, I really liked the movie and enjoyed it, but I couldnt help but laugh when Carrel was laughing even though he was a ""bad guy"" in this movie.. :Pï»¿"
i agree wit kubkoï»¿
what did you want the mom to throw Steve Carell out of the car and die while they reunite with Duncan's dad and all live happily at the waterpark?ï»¿
"@daveman11qÂ yea, and boobs.There should have been more boobsï»¿"
"@Kubko HNa. it was kinda real, ya know? Some of us have moments like that where we ujust don't want to go, but it's time. It was a fantastic film, seriously loved it. And yeah, he got a kiss from the girl he liked, and walked away brimming with confidence. I loved it.ï»¿"
"@Kubko H the things you mention are what made it so great.  That is real life, especially that one time kiss. I'm grown now, but I clearly remember times like this.  A brief kiss or a flirt that, when you look back, could have been so much more...but it isn't, it's only a memory.  I absolutely loved this movie.  Touching, funny, sad...all of it drawing from real emotion.  I will watch it again.ï»¿"
@3 0 5Â I just decided to watch it again too tonight :P .. I think I matured since I posted that coment so maybe I will look at it diffrentlyï»¿

i had the same problem with the movie.. but that shows how amazing of an actor he is. If you cant get past that problem i really recommend 'seeking a friend for the end of the world'. He is a really warm gentleman in that movie so much so that you think he is stupid at times. ï»¿

Sam Rockwell. Allison Janney. Toni Collette. Wow. This movie is loaded with a lot of super talented yet underrated actors. ï»¿
Nat Faxon sucks.ï»¿
"This would be good if they wernt doing the same bull shit they always do in movies where they put a normal looking actor who suppose to be a kid who doesnt fit in. When they get a kid who looks the part then I would watch it. You wouldent watch an action movie that instead of a big muscle guy, they get a scrawny teen heart throb to play his part a bad azz killer. When the movie makes since and the actor is credible then I will watch your movie.ï»¿"
Deantastic!ï»¿
