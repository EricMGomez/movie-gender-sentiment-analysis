DREAMS DONâ€™T PAY THE BILLS!!!!ï»¿
I wish I can find the DVD of mariposa del  barrio of Jenni Rivera if any one knows where I can find it too buy it let me now ...ï»¿
Love. Jenniï»¿
Chingo? Baby Beesh? Tfffffï»¿
crapï»¿
I love Gina Rodriguez .ï»¿
before Jane the virginï»¿
Chrissie fit was in the movie!ï»¿
"Music was TERRIBLE . Filly"" wasn't even a little bit attractive. Shitty acting like straight up bad acting, bad story line - music wasn't even the slightest bit catchy but the main problem the rapping was NOT good at all. Disappointed :( only reason I would ever let anyone watch this is to see the guy that played Ritchie Valens in La Bamba. (He was taking a Spanish accent by the way which was kind of embarrassing because it sounded awful) id give it, -78 out of 5 stars.ï»¿"
A G your motherï»¿
A decent movie. I enjoyed how Majo(Filly Brown) beat the guy who punched her sister.ï»¿

"So you're saying that Edward James Olmos is a bad actor? This seems like a good movie. Especially with Jenni Rivera. Maybe you should watch it, support your people and then you can see better films. Other than that, I think I'll give this girl Gina Rodriguez a chance. After all, Zoe Saldana's first movie was Crossroads with Britney Spears. And look at her now?Â ï»¿"
What the heck! Chrisse fitt or idk umm.. From teen beach movie! CHEECHEE YA!ï»¿

"Was able to watch Filly Brown in advance last weekend. The trailer doesn't do this movie justice, all of the actors did a great job. If you're a Jenni Rivera fan like me, all of you are going to be surprised at how good of a job she does. Anyone who doesn't cry by the end of the last scene of this movie has no soul. Go see this movie, seriously.ï»¿"
Cayate pinche mierdaï»¿

Why the fuck ignorant people watch jenn if they dont like her keep shit to yourself and get the fuck out like seriously she is in a Better place lets wait for your mama death see how that feels. If u got something to say about MEX culture then say it who gives a shit ass what your  demented racist issues got to say so get out of usa because is a free country full of immigrants.ï»¿
"I know people are just going to watch this for Jenni Rivera..im not, im just going to watch it for the other actors Lou Diamond Phillips, Baby bash and all the other mexican rappers...altough I think this movie is not going to be all that.ï»¿"
Nigga please get a life!ï»¿
"Fuck all those haters like jenni used to say ""haters can continue to kiss my ass""ï»¿"
Respect to jenni but I think selena is better and ppl are making here more annoying nowï»¿
"If you trying to say ""be equal"" or something, your saying pretty harsh. Don't be ignorantï»¿"
What's that beat from 0:27 to 0:31 calledï»¿
I hate Jenny... She was on the news for like 2 months straight like seriously??? She died. Big woop. Life goes on.. And then her brothers have been acting up for atention???? I hate the Riveras screw thisï»¿
