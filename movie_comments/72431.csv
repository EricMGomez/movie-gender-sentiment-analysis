@tmendez31 I just wish it was better because its such an important story.  The movie is not doing well or getting a lot of great reviews.   As a vfx professional there is a lot in this movie that is not as good as it could be but I know why.  so I have a bit of a bias from that knowedge and coming from an air force family growing up on air forces bases with pilots.  I do understand it hard to show a flight of 300 b17's without cg  but they dont need to look plastic. ï»¿

"@tmendez31 CG doesn't mean it has to be bad cg that looks like a video game.   And the boat they shot at was a sorte of p47's not p51s.

"@lemmonmcIV Yep. Every other war movie has fictional characters and situations in a historic setting, yet those movies haven't been critiqued like this. Did they complain about ""Pearl Harbor"" having fighter pilots turn into bomber pilots, or even complain about Charlie Sheen's character in Platoon shooting one of his own? Nope. It's all just an attempt to downplay it because they fear a some kind of black uprising (or Obama re-election tactic) from watching a movie.ï»¿"

"Notice the extreme detail people (white I assume) are combing this movie on a molecular level in terms of accuracy. Ask  yourself, has this ever be done to plethora of 'white' WW2  movies...and you'll find the objective answer is no.  Think this is just a stupid comment, I suggest you ask the Bombers they escorted. Talking smack on you tube might feel cool, but making it home alive to see your family and children, with a red tail escort probably trumps that. Just saying.ï»¿"
@TomRe46 I like to show people scenes from Memphis belle next to this and ask which one they like better.  most I have asked like Memphis belle better because those fight scenes are really about telling the story not just showing CG crazy land that distracts from the story. and I do CG for a living.   also they show a p51 shooting a destroyer.  It as a p47 and its UNCONFIRMED KILL to this day.  unknow type size and class ship was shot at.ï»¿
"@rgarcia77 Chucks favored way to shoot down 262's was when they where landing.  He said that in his book.   He also said he had very little luck shooting them down in Dog fights unless they made mistakes or they where the FB model that was very difficult to fly and not as fast as the straight fighter model.  ï»¿"
"@sneakurp if you read what Chuck yeager had to say about fighting me 262's he said he would wait until they ran out of fuel and shoot them while they where landing.   VERY few 262's where shot down in actual combat because they knew they didn't have to turn with the mustang just run away at 100mph faster.   The one that where shot down where either FB models or rookie pilots.  ï»¿"

"@Royalfork1 So, I guess we could conclude that the jet-fighters of WWII came out a little before their time?  Thanks for clarifying that for me.ï»¿"
"@broylesgilbert19 The Me-262 was much better than the P-51, the issues stems from the 262 coming late in the war and thus suffering from terrible fuel shortages and increasing lack of well trained pilots(lack of fuel forced cutbacks in training flights) Additionally the vast majority of me-262s lost were either destroyed on the ground or during landing and take off when the aircraft was slowing.ï»¿"

"@broylesgilbert19.  He had no idea, but he knew everything about football, basketball and hockey.  Next time I see him I will see if he knows what a Corsair is, I bet he doesn't know that one either!  It seems to me that many common knowledge facts about history are not being passed on to new generations.  Sad that they had to make the difference between the Me109 and the P-51 so colorful.  What do you think about the fictional ""skull"" markings on the German planes?  ï»¿"
@numpty842 Germany's ME-262's were the best until we came out with the P-51.ï»¿
@Humbertusmarius He did not know?  Ask him if he knows what Corsair is.ï»¿
"@Tarten46.  Thanks, you hit the nail on the head with your explanation.  The average movie goer must be pretty ignorant if that is the case.  Not long ago, at my son's baptism I met a guy who did not know what the hell a ""Spitfire"" was! I actually thought he was joking. ï»¿"
@Willitinator who didnt know that?ï»¿
@FrankiePie21 only if you assume every white american was a racist. i was lucky enough to be raised by this generation. youd be surprised how many whites came back from the battlefield with great admiration for black units. most likely the number one contributing factor and support for the civil rights movement. ï»¿

"@NedHunt8house dude i was trolling lol stukas were shot out of the skies like flies on all fronts, as if they had a chance against even a spitfire or an il-2 or something. If you look closely at 2:08 you can see a stuka close to the camera, its cabin and rudder visible ï»¿"
"@sneakurp first of all those did not look like stukas. second of all stukas are dive bombers. second of all if they even were able to get in the air, the tuskegee airmen, flying p-51 mustangs, which are fighters, would easily knock them out of the airï»¿"
cant wait to see it looks like an awesome movieï»¿
"@FrankiePie21 hmm Saying that they saved lives is almost hypocritical, those bombers that they were protecting would end up killing over 500,000 innocent civilians by wars end (and thats just against Germany, not to mentioned what we did to japan), so maybe its you who should pick up a history book. ï»¿"

@DickLodge68 well personally im half iraqi. so all these people saying im racist are obviously wrong. otherwise how would i stand being around half of my family. and yes racism is racism. but not racism is not racism. and thats where being over sensitive comes in. its like some of these guys want me to have had racist intent just so they can have a dig about me being racist. regardless of what grounds they hadï»¿
"From the trailers this looks exceptionally well done.  I just hope the dialogue does not get too political.  I realize these guys fought against extremely tough foes, both from the Axis powers and racists on their own side.  This should focus on their bravery, skill and the kick ass job they did ""over there"".  The Tuskegee guys were not just legends,  they were stone cold professional killers.  Bomber crews loved em!  ï»¿"
"@mrchrisanolliewollie I understand your point...my point is that racism is racism, no matter being ""over -sensitive"". Look at La Raza - simple meaning ""The Race"". That's offensive. Some are offended here by calling African-Americans ""black"". Well, tough shit! I'm a white guy but don't need to be called an Irish-Germanic-American.....absurd!

"@DickLodge68 its being over sensitive about racism to the point where its racist the other way around.

"@mrchrisanolliewollie Explain to me what the hell ""anti-racism"" is? That sounds like a good thing! Racism is racism. I'm white, he's black, get over it! And racism is far beyond color, it's religion too! Look at that greedy Jew! Bottom line is prejudice. Some pre-judge on color,creed, race...I don't.

"@gjohnsoningary ok ok ok. men of honour. that film was about the main characters determination to become a scuba diver and the obstacles he has to overcome in order to do so. racism was one of those obstacles (albeit the main one). it addressed racism whilst not treating the audience as ignorants who are unaware of racism. unlike tmendez seems to think, my parents have taught me about racism and respect. so i dont like films that appear to overdo the whole racism is bad thing. i get it alreadyï»¿"
"@S4Mification yes, its looks terrible because it looks like 90 minutes of anti racism talk being shoved down our throats. put 2 and 2 together. and im not saying its looks bad because it anti racism, just because it looks like it would be overwhelming in the amount that appears to be present. a point which everyone appears to have missed. you say i have no balls but if you had any idea who i really was then you wouldnt dare call me a racist cos you would no its bullshitï»¿"
"@tmendez31 the fact of the matter is all of you are being extremely pretentious. None of you know me and are basing your thoughts of me on a movie. I've stopped caring now.

"@Hopfolk I'll have to agree with you but at the same time it's a movie. In my opinion the masses don't seem interested in education, as such the film makers have to include the entertainment factor. I do see your point though. The phrase ""I feel like I'm driving my grandfathers Buick"" doesn't really make much sense in the 40s. I'm still going to see the movie anyway.ï»¿"
@tmendez31 also the whole point of a trailer is to entice people into seeing the movie. so if it doesnt do that id say the people who made the movie do probably care about itï»¿
"@tmendez31 well, at least you are trying to make a point instead of just calling me racist and talking about lynching which there are really no grounds for in the first place. Are you saying that i need to say this is good or watch it in order to show respect. and that doing otherwise is disrespectful. because i love saving private ryan, not because im supposed to but because i think its a good movie.ï»¿"
"@systematic101 Indeed, and I am sure that those gentlemen were polite and restrained, like most people in 1940s America. This film seems to be using modern phrases and enthusiasms in order to create an ideal that did not exist. The Red-tails endured some pretty awful racial abuse at the time, and won grudging respect for their bravery and sheer skill. Whooping and egotistical jock-talk only serves to make them look arrogant, which they most assuredly were not.ï»¿"

Fact of the matter is, i was making a reference about something to do with the film rather than something racial. you being this tremendously over-sensitive is just going to cause you problems.

Why does Terrance Howard's voice always tremble??ï»¿
"@Nanostarification yes, shut us own.ï»¿"
I support the movie but terrance howard has the same acting performance like keanu reaves. It's the same style as in iron man. He annoys me because he has no acting range. Besides hustle and flow. Aaron should have chose a better lead. Put a new good actor. It takes the corny factor away.ï»¿
Black tails would be a better titleï»¿
