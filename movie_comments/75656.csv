"please help me out. i just finished watching the movie. but don't really understand what i get into. need to know why Morgan Freeman end up in jail. is it because he is after all the magicians and paying for his ego???i know he was plotted by Dylan   the cop but why?and what is there to do with Dylan's dad death in the movie?i am confused....may be he died because he could not open the safe. wtfhelp me understand the story pleaseï»¿"

He does not count as Lex Luthor because his acting was not appropriate as Lex :( He was just as insane as the joker.... And Lex is NOT the joker.... So disappointing. Maybe it was the director's fault but THAT was NOT Lex :(ï»¿
@Pearlareign I actually think he'll start acting like the original Lex when he gets out of prison. He becomes serious and bald. The long haired Lex is kinda funny though. :Pï»¿

What makes a good movie? Being unpredictable. For a while was so confused about the plot...the whole thing seem really scattered and didn't make sense....until the end when it all came together.

Highly recommend this movie and if there is ever a sequel...and I hope there is...I will be sure to what itï»¿

"What I still don't get.. why are they called the four horsemen? The four horsemen are Death, Pestilence, Famine and War, not (Death), The Lovers, The High Priestess and The Hermit.

"Spoiler: I liked the movie, very well played out and albeit certain were predictable I thoroughly enjoyed it.. My only grip is the ending, I didn't think that it made sense given each of the characters roles. I felt the French interpool agent should have been more involved in the twist.ï»¿"

"Movie is okay but not outstanding. The basic idea is really nice, only it's worked out poorly. Too much over the top in my opinion.Â Let Christopher Nolan direct this movie and maybe then we are talking:)ï»¿"

this is a GREAT MOVIE!!!! LOVE IT!!! i hope theres part 2.ï»¿
Quite overhyped. It was ok.ï»¿
"In my opinion this movie was pretty crappy. Some of the acting was poor and a lot of it did not make sense or was stretched a bit too far. In particular the way the policeman acted just did not add up with the story.Someone earlier compared this to Prestige, well in my opinion Prestige was way more solid and had great acting. This was just passably entertaining ...ï»¿"

"So, apparantly... when the zombie apocalypse subsided rapidly, Tallahassee and Columbus had no purpose, so they assumed new identities as illusionists, meetingÂ former shopaholic Ms. Bloomwood and former studentÂ Eric Molson (who have undergone new identites as well)Â along the way to form TheÂ Four Horsemen, all the while evading capture from the Hulk, Alfred Pennyworth,Â and Lucius Fox.ï»¿"

"the car chase scene... he steals the FBI car and drives. and then after some seconds the blonde comes, the agent enter the cars, they have a little talk and they start chasing. And in the next scene they are right behind the other car. Am i the only here that finds this disturbing?Â ï»¿"
Trailer shows almost the whole movie. I loved all the dialogs and details but I think it's better if people just watch the 'first 5 minutes' on Youtube. Hook line and sinker. Everyone in this movie was so hot!! :Dï»¿
best movie everrrï»¿
"Looks brilliant, great movie but ending was kind of a key downï»¿"
Best movie of the year.Â ï»¿
"Prestige is just overrated, both of movies have things thats not make sense. But suspense, plot and ending much better than prestigeï»¿"

"This movie is better than the Prestige in my opinion, the Prestige took on a realistic approach to magic but Now you see me captured it in it's true elements, not being able to tell reality from fantasy and always being lost in the moment of the trick being performedï»¿"

After watching the film i've realised that this trailer gives away almost every trick in the film lol. but you wouldn't know it did until you've watched it. and the clever keeps on coming...ï»¿

I watched part of this with my friends. I really want to finish it!! :Dï»¿

Such a good movie! You think you can work it out and predict certain things then it completely fools you. Put together so well!ï»¿
i thought the first rule of magic was to never reveal the secrets.ï»¿
Such a good movie :) it was definitely not predictable unlike other magic movies. Epic and unexpected twist! MUST WATCH. RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. 5/5*ï»¿
did anyone notice morgan freeman gain a freckle when he explained the plot :D (a south park reference just in case people call me an idiot cause they don't understand)ï»¿
Bad ending for an overall fun movie. Still worth watching :Dï»¿

I've just watched the movie and all i can say is. IT WAS AWESOME!ï»¿
indian movie DHOOM 3 has cpoied from now you see me....bollywood is copied from hollywoodï»¿
"haha thought you'd written ""poo"" when I first read it :Pï»¿"
no cuz morgan freeman killed da fbi'd dad!ï»¿
I looked over all the observations. I believe that itâ€™s a respectable vid. My younger brother wants to become outstanding with gals. He was taught a fuck load from a web page called Master Attraction. (Google it if you want pretty good emails on picking up girls.) The tips about seducing girls from night clubs from Master Attraction got him his very first sex in around a couple of years. I became pissed though coz I heard them all. Terrible.ï»¿
Woodkid <3 wooï»¿
Good to know i am not the only one to do that !! :Pï»¿
Good movie. Not groundbreaking but an entertaining 2 hours nonetheless. Check out my review at my blog: VIEWS ON FILM.  comï»¿
PGG brought me here :Vï»¿
"The reason morgan freeman was framed was because he was making videos to reveal their magic tricks? All that money to frame someone and in the end, only care about the EYE?! Very interesting... Confusing but love the movie!!!!ï»¿"
This was the best movie I have ever seen.ï»¿
"I watched it , and it's incredible and genius , it deserves 10/10ï»¿"
Some people here commenting are soo ignorant do your research on films before you write something stupidï»¿
Dhoom 3 has absolutely no similarity with this movie. I dont understand why people are comparing the two. ï»¿
This was literally one of the best movies Ive ever seen.ï»¿
dhoom 3 hahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. but the film started shooting before the release of the film and its script was ready much before that so unless the director of now u see me gave him the script i do not know how he got the ideaï»¿
Fuck indians they r a carbon copy dhoom 3 totally copiedï»¿
How can u say that ? Indians copy :Dï»¿
"How can Dhoom 3 be a copy of this you morons? Dhoom 3 was shot in 2012, when Now you See Me was still in pre production and Dhoom 3's script was written 4 years ago?ï»¿"
"fuck u indians,,,,again you copied,,,,, ,fuck fuck fuckï»¿"
If you haven't watched a ton of movies to compare this too you'll like this one. Typical cheesy Hollywood movie. The Prestige was a good movie about magic. Not as modern but a damn good one.ï»¿
"Great film i had a hard time predicting the plot apart from the bridge and safe scene and that plot twist near the end wow, really worth it.ï»¿"
Loved that movie it really got me in the endï»¿
"Just watched it two times in a row, but the twist in the end, really confused me (any chance someone could explain it to me more) thank youï»¿"
like if you're here after dhoom 3 trailer!ï»¿
you could see it... now you can'tï»¿
Biggest plot twist Ive seen :Oï»¿

"I want to discover ways to get laid. My friend has started seeing a stunning lady mainly because 8 weeks back he joined an internet site called Master Attraction (Google it if youâ€™d like to learn how.)

How could you transform that rapidly? His ladyâ€™s like a modelâ€_ï»¿"

yeah but its because the ending is showing that magic is real (even though it isn't)ï»¿
actually most of the tricks are real. they had to learn them all.ï»¿
What kind of ass backward statement was that?ï»¿
OMG DIS MOVIE WAS GOOD MY FAV MOVIE I WATCHED IT TODAY:-)ï»¿
The best magic trick this movie pulled off was fooling the audience into thinking this was a Nolan film.ï»¿
Don't get the ending. Can somebody explain it to meï»¿
Only worth going to the theater for this movie if you happen to have good weed.  I prefer trainwreck.ï»¿
He was involved in the death of Agent Rhodes' father.  You might have missed it because they just spew out everything in the last 20 min.  The plot could have been developed better.ï»¿
Special effects happened.ï»¿
I did not think Morgan freeman character deserved what happened to him? He really never did anything wrong but expose the tricksï»¿
looks like a real cool movie but eisenberg seems to be exactly the same character that he was in sosial network.a annoying little miss know-it-all.I hate that guy.otherwise movie is ok.ï»¿

People don't over thinking its a shit movie none of it makes sense. I mean all of a sudden a magician can do martial arts and drive a car like fast and furious movie? It is stupidï»¿

"@Robby303 Because he is the 5th Horsemen You dumbass. -_- He is the one behind all the tricks that has been made. ï»¿"
50% on rottentomatos and I don't blame them. The last 30 minutes ruined the whole movie. I mean the guy on the merry go around disappears and before that he goes out of jail with no explanation. Really pathetic ending ï»¿

"Yes , it was one of the dumbest, worst acted movies i've ever seen. With plot twist you could see from miles away, and these awful, supposedly cool magic moments. The whole story was as if it was written by an infant.ï»¿"
"at the end, it explained that the mysterious guy who gained the four horsemen was dylan himself. thadeus bradley revealed lionel shrike's trick which was dylan's father. so shrike did a show to prove that he was still a great magician. but it failed because he drown and never came back. tressler insurance refused his father's claim, the claim was saved in the paris bank (credit republican de paris) and elkhorn is the safes company which was used in shrike's last performance it's dylan's revengeï»¿"

Its a feel good kind of thing which you're really just supposed to flow with. And chill, there is going to be a sequel, and hopefully it will be just as awesome.ï»¿"
Robert Downey is Iron Man. The actor you're thinking of above Mark Ruffalo plays Bruce Banner aka The Hulk.ï»¿
The entire movie is a distraction to it's own ending. Very well played out. The movie truly has a magical illusion like quality because you never suspect the ending.ï»¿
"Really good movie!! <3ï»¿"
seriously!?ï»¿
Why watch the trailer if you've already watched the video and then say you hate it? This movie is one of the best movies. Simple. suspense from the begininning!ï»¿
Just might be the worst movie i've ever seen. Ugh!ï»¿

This shit was weak. Wasted 2 hours for a gay 'twist' at the endï»¿
Just saw it with friends. Mindblown! Haven't been this surprised by a film in a looong time. All films nowadays tend to be predictable so this was very refreshing and stirring.ï»¿

"The movie should be called ""Now you see me, now this movie is crap""ï»¿"
"This ain't a movie, its a fucking piece of shit!ï»¿"

"This is the best movie I have ever seen,I totally recommend it!ï»¿"

Shhhhhhhh little kid...... shhhhhhhhhhhï»¿
"this was actually quite a good movie, I was surprised.ï»¿"

"here..thank me later... ;) viooz.co/movies/19001-now-you-see-me-2013. html   ï»¿"
Top 5 2013ï»¿
There's something wrong with you.ï»¿
"LOVED the movie but the ending failed me... think it makes no sense that Thadeus got arrested for the last robbery...come on, after all that 'trickery' throughout the movie the police really thought that Thadeus would take the money and put it in his van?ï»¿"
loved it! so good!ï»¿
run boyï»¿
honestly its not so good. just watched it last night. im not satisfied and feels like theres something wrong with this movie.ï»¿
Just watched it its pretty good. :) didnt think i'd like it but i really did. Watch till thee end its a shocker!ï»¿
movieï»¿
the best movie ive ever seen on my lifeï»¿
"They made God fooled ! HERETICS !Burn them,burn them all !ï»¿"
"I watched The Prestige, and I adore and love it. Movies these days have no spins, all predictable, if I can't predict the end or even if I can but its a good ending, it's the BEST to me. ï»¿"
"This movie had potential to be great, but came off as cheezy. I think the imdb rating is way too high...ï»¿"
"Just search ""100 reasons why evolution is stupid""ï»¿"
"I know it sounds like spam but its the truth brother. I know there are a ton of translations but the KJV is the best English one. And I promise you evolution is NOT science, it's actually a faith based theory.ï»¿"
"please stop spamming religion... btw the bible has been re-written a gazillion times and gets twisted each time. Cant base my existence on inaccurate books. Besides science has proven we evolved from apes not no adam and eve...... blah blah blah ï»¿"
"That's the real ""FINAL TRICK"" that he's prepping the WHOLE WORLD for with movies such as this, along with all the other media, ""education systems"", wars, false religious teachings, and war trauma. THE SOLUTION? It's actually relatively simple ;-). Receive a love for the truth, REPENT (say sorry for the bad stuff you've done), BE BAPTISED (full immersion), Call on the mighty name of YASHUA (""JESUS""), and read/follow the TEN COMMANDMENTS (Exodus 20 King James Version). Peace & Love ;-)ï»¿"
"IN ANY CASE y'all, the truth is much more interesting than fiction, and the fact is that this movie is hinting at the TRUTH which is going to come. The Devil will masquerade as a messenger of light, attempt to impersonate the Messiah by ushering in a false/temporary global ""peace"", cause all to receive a mark and worship him (as elaborated on in the book of Revelation), and ride out his last exercise of dominance until Yahusha the Jewish Messiah and Savior of all who accept him comes back.ï»¿"
"You can see solid plain evidence of the setting up of the scenario for this last great deception by the fact that the UN has almost all the world in political alignment. Also telling is the fact that there is a World Council of Churches, BUT notice that all those religions are subject to the pope, so it is not a real roundtable. And the only system of faith that will have NO common ground with all others will be the Jewish faith, even though they don't currently all accept Yashuah the Messiah.ï»¿"
"Brothers and Sisters, I just want to point out that you all should understand that the devil is the head magician around, considering magic is deception/misdirection/lies, and he is called ""the father of lies."" And his last ""great"" ""trick"" is going to be the impersonation of the Messiah, when he comes as a world leader to usher in a false global peace. He will require all to receive a mark as prophesied in Revelation, to which the response should be NO.ï»¿"
Morgan Freeman....ï»¿
"Underrated? Lol, it's fucking not. It's overrated as fuck. Bullshit of a movie. You want magic/illusions, then you'll watch 'The Prestige'. This was just bad. I think the hype got into you all.ï»¿"
I've never seen a better movie in my life!!!ï»¿
Can someone explain to me the end of the film?ï»¿
"Well. What can I say. I disagree. It was a decent movie, that's for sure, but best..? Definitely not. (In my opinion, of course.)ï»¿"
I only just noticed this has the same trailer song as dying lightï»¿
"Awesome movie, new favourite!ï»¿"

"The best movie of the year. Also the most underrated of the year. It deserved more success. BTW, I know the gross box office but still as a fan I wanted it to succeed more than it did. Cant wait for the second one.ï»¿"
Underrated? I mean a 70 Million dollar movie with a gross box office of 321 million dollars worldwide and 117 Million Dollars in the US alone... I don't see how it became underratedï»¿
"The Director, the actors the script writers... oh man! Everything was perfect! One of the best Movies I have ever seenï»¿"

"Now You See Me atiwantmovies.infoï»¿"

"bolts and screws! Just started drinking. My spirit is seriously lacking. Cant help but see the witnesses. Its in plain sight!ï»¿"
"""True, it does look like rain"". Just cant tare my eyes away. Better lock up your desires folks. Manifesting what you want to see. ""Fear where he doesn't know"". Hunger for my own destruction... With out possession of its flesh any longer. Calculating what you cant see, but think you see, for maybe your own good. How else to protect a baby. Such a famine. Some trains once loosed need good conductors. Don't forge those ï»¿"

Uhm the ending was amazing. The person was the last one I would have guessed.ï»¿
I don't want to insult you...Yes I do......But I won't......OK....So the obvious explanation is that he was trying to hide his real identity from the 4 horsemen.ï»¿
"Or there won't be a sequel. ""Now You Don't"" indeed.ï»¿"

I seen the movie its awesomeï»¿
"thank you ,i agree.ï»¿"
I like how people cant handle a difference of opinion and had to hide my comment.Its the comment section not the possitive comment section.ï»¿
If you like this movie then watch the Prestige. In my opinion is a better movie.ï»¿
"This movie is the poster child for why folks illegally download.  Horrible, horrible movie with big names and expensive production values.  The premise is ridiculous. The story is junk.  The dialog is awful.  The acting goes from wooden to inept.  Unwatchable.  At least if you download it you can see it at 8x speed and not feel so bad.ï»¿"
"not that bad of a movie, its aightï»¿"
"It's a movie, of course it's full of shit.ï»¿"

"No, I'm just stating my opinion. Do you even have to ask?ï»¿"
who are you? Movie Bible or some sort?ï»¿
"Watched it yesterday and it was crap. The movie was probably made for the younger crowd specially those who are fans of magic. If you don't like bullshit thrown at your face, very cocky attitude from main characters, obsession towards magic and predictable endings, then this movie is not for you. A very basic movie full of holes and unrealistic events and behaviors. If you don't mind all that, the movie stills drags a lot with loads of bullshit so its not that entertaining. Watchable at best.ï»¿"
THIS MOVIE IS KINDA FULL OF SHITï»¿
Google James Randiï»¿
I didn't understand shit!ï»¿
Oh I'm sure it is lol It would just be cool if that's what they called it. ï»¿

illuminati crapï»¿
thank god !!!! a normal person ....ï»¿
this is just the tip of my thoughts nothing made sense the so called magic tricks were just special efects that hypnothist guy was like a super hero or sth controling people like that and at the ending they could have put any actor in the fifth horseman place and it still woudnt be any clierer...ï»¿
this movie is full with illuminati lolï»¿
"The ending setting up MF character, didn't get the purpose of that, it was never explained. Kept waiting for it.ï»¿"
my godddddd !!! this is not a movie ..just some effects show !!!! the story line s poor and then we take money and give it to people bullshit and last : wawww magic can do anything .... they tried to mix the illusionist with some bank-robbing movies ...at least the other movies explain shit not just : well we are magicians we can do it .... RIP brain of the 20000 people who liked it btw ï»¿
Loved this movie! Magic is badass!ï»¿
The ending was kind of confusing... and the only real reason i liked the movie was because of sexy Dave Franco xDï»¿

"This movie is so bad. I can't believe I watched it. Actors were good but the storyline was poor, nothing interesting happening. Yeah, the end was surprising but I was bored the whole time. It has almost the same rating on IMDb as World War Z. WWZ was way better that this.ï»¿"
I really enjoyed this movie. Cant say the same about a few others I've seen at the theaters recently.ï»¿

"no you are not. that's the point. Just about everyone watching this also picked the 7 of diamonds. That's how the trick is done. When he's flipping through the cards, it stop a split second longer on that specific card so that your brain can register what it is. The magician picks the card, not you.ï»¿"

Great movieï»¿
1:25ï»¿
"I'm a huge mystery/thriller and heist fan so I was thrilled to see this movie. However, the ending disappoints. No sufficient/believable explanations. Up until the reveal though I thought it was a great movie. No doubt the screenwriter struggled with the perfect ending and this one falls flat.ï»¿"
yeah I know I guessed the story right from the beginning ï»¿
does anyone know the song they played while being introduced on the stage in las vegas?ï»¿
"Exactly the hulk gave no explanation and they could have done a time lapse and showed why in fact he felt it necessary  to move in the action he did with Morgan Freeman In the end (get what I'm saying)!ï»¿"
so this is kinda like Ocean's something but with magic ï»¿
Best movie ever ï»¿
"You're very welcome! Soooooo good and out of the blue, right? Glad you enjoyed it!ï»¿"
What if Hulk is a magician and he was the one that trapped Avengers into this and now we actually see this movie as a pre-sequel of Avengers? :Oï»¿

"Everything about this film screams illuminati. Everything. Quite funny that in pop culture Morgan Freeman is known as ""God"" for the role he plays and in this film the puppets - the four horsemen (of the apocalypse) who are controlled by the all-seeing eye end up framing him. Everyone blames God, don't they?ï»¿"

"You got it spot on! First time ever I was so frustrated in the cinema, I was getting a headache after a while, just couldn't wait until it was over. The movie was so terribly put together, a few good scenes just shoved together with barely any build up between them. And I knoww right I was just thinking WTF, such a crappy predictable twist, and then a stupid ending.. It's like Harry potter waking up in the end of the last film in the sequel and saying it was all a dream, just stupid. ï»¿"
This movie was amazing(:ï»¿
"totally agree. after just 30 minutes I was so pissed of I couldnt sit still... this filme is so shit, I felt like my brain was being mauled. what the heck was that carousel?!?!come on guys, you watched Bourne's trillogy, you watched Hannibal and a bunch od others, you know what a good FBI film is. If you wanna see magic stuff watch The Prestige, Nikola Tesla is in it, a good lad!Just don't waste ur time with this genuine and must fine specie of piece of crap movieMorgan Freeman shame on you! ï»¿"

"This movie was absolute bullshit. Always happens when you get a load of good actors in one film.. The story is so shit. The actors however played their roles good and that's the only reason this movie was watchable. The twists are so predictable and it's honestly a really really shit film, up there with my most hated. So boring.ï»¿"

"open your eyes in 3,2,1........... FUUUUUUUUï»¿"
why ï»¿
"The twist is stupid, Thaddeus ( Freeman ) kept trolling his(FBI-Guy) father by unfolding his tricks ----> Lost his father who sucked in 'magic' Safe trick gone wrong --->FBI agent gets mad ---> Creates master plan ---> Four others execute his plan ---> FBI Agent chases his pawns --> Becomes master genius ---> Falls in love with his assistant ---> finds love ----> Sinking key linking to his dad ----> key is love/acceptance? ----> End. yeah, that is the whole movie in one post.ï»¿"
yes he is...ï»¿
No the twist is that the main detective guy is the 5th horseman haha I'm sorry. SPOILER DONT LOOKï»¿
"****SPOILER*****Ok mr smart pants, aka bighands69 *mature*. The twist is lame because in the whole story he puts 100% effort in trying to catch the bad guys. He even accepts the case that nobody took serious. He has no real motive to try and catch Morgan Freeman. And the ending was even worse when they all jumped on the carousel. And last but not least, why do all this work to catch Morgan Freeman, while he could have trapped him in one of his magic tricks anyway.ï»¿"

"No he is not. Maybe you need to see the film again as your understanding is quite limited. ï»¿"

"They are two different types of films. One is a good piece of entertainment the other is a film of craft. Both of them have deep meaning locked up within their presentation. To 99.999% of people who see both films they will only view them as films and not look below the surface. ï»¿"
The trailer gives so much away! So glad I went and was PLEASANTLY surprised! This movie has the right amount of humour too!ï»¿
"I think the DVD/Blu Rays haven't been made yet so the only available torrents are Cams, same thing with pain and gain, the discs haven't been made yet because some movies like this one release in US first and then other major countries many months later, this movie only came out here in the UK 2 days ago, be patient my friend.ï»¿"
hey lets make a trailer thats too long and reveals most of the plot and spoils the movie a bit!ï»¿

I dont know how many times the Eye of the Horus flashed itself on screen. Summit knew how crappy the ending was (because some tree shone light out and a carousel happened to be there) so they just made sure the whole story revolved around some mind fucked shit.ï»¿
then you obviously dont know a good movie when you see it.ï»¿
"Yes. or were you expecting to read ""ridonkulous""? I cannot comprehend how bad the ending was. ï»¿"

"Surprised this movie has so many rave reviews. First hour or so of the movie was quite good, although I thought it was a bit of a drag. I was very disappointed with the ending. Also, some of the ""tricks"" were plain ridiculous, like when she was floating and doing moves in a bubble. Could have made that more realistic to match the loud applause and cheers from the audience. And really, the ending sucks.ï»¿"

According to ancient occult literature the eye is a symbol that represents ancient secret societies of magicians. Not necessarily conventional magicians like David Copperfield or Chris Angel but magicians means people with enough mental power to fool others and that is the magic. If they got to join the eye that means the will not only be protected by higher hierarchies of power but also will be thought secret knowledge or wisdom.  ï»¿
"THE COP IS THE MAIN MAGICIAN A.K.A THE FIFTH HORSEMENTHEY HAVE BEEN HELPING THE FOUR ALL ALONGï»¿"
"*SPOILER*----After watching this movie, I don't understand why would the four horsemen risk so much just to join the Eye of Horus. Can anyone explain what's in it for them that they'd risk life imprisonment or death?ï»¿"
saw it today!ï»¿
yea because if i were 9 id prob be too smart to watch such a fake movie.ï»¿
"you're not very intelligent huh. doesn't matter where its stolen from its stolen money. And giving it to an audience is too much evidence, no one in history walks out of jail after doing that. If i was 8 it would prob be fun to watch.ï»¿"
It was such an awesome movie! It was so good I want to see it againï»¿
This movie was soooo good! And mindblowing! I can watch this over .. and over... and over!!ï»¿

"Ur fkin kidding me right, the trick was to rob a bank, how ever you want to look at it the money was taken from Paris then dumped over the crowd as part of their trick. How can they hold them? is that a serious question.. maybe a good movie for 8 year olds.ï»¿"
OMFG! This movie is SO awesome!!! Whoever is wanting to see this you really should!!! It is very unexpected.ï»¿
"They didnt rob the bank lmfao.. The audience was given over 3 million, from the bank in Paris.. It was they're magic trick yet police let them walk free, about the dumbest shit ive seen in awhile.ï»¿"
It is really really an amazing film with a fantastic and un expected endï»¿
way to hyped trailer... this movie was ok but not the best movie i give it 4 out of 10ï»¿
0:14 EPICNESSï»¿
"Its one of those trailers that make a movie look sick when it actually isnt. Trust me its not this crazy movie where these magicians are the big Boss that run everything. The plot is poorly made. In the end u can watch it but im pretty sure right after the credits roll, your gunna want your money back.ï»¿"
"they rob a bank for over 3 million the police take them in and let them go so they can rob again, about the dumbest crap ive ever seen.ï»¿"
"Watching this movie in less than an hour, so excited :Dï»¿"

Mark Ruffalo: I'll show you a magic trick. I'll turn into a big green beast before your very eyesï»¿
really mindfucking but i recommend ï»¿
wow that was amazingï»¿
"Here's the truth to people who haven't seen it yet -- I went into it thinking it was going to be a slick film with a group of illusionists pulling off a clever bank heist something like Ocean's Eleven only with magicians. What I got was a movie that didn't didn't deliver on ANYTHING at all. BOSH. Bunch of shit happens, the end. ""The Eye"" lol, a plot so incredibly stupid it satisfies the dumbest movie-goer because there is nothing to it, I lost hope in humanity just reading these comments smh...ï»¿"
"Just say it today, and I have to say that it was an awesome movie. Was it perfect? Absolutely not. But it was still freaking awesomeï»¿"
there are some that say it sucked and most say its a good movie should i get my hopes up or not??cause it looks awesomeï»¿

0:28 he look likes Tony stark . Robert Ps Jrï»¿
"A marvellous movie with twists and turns .The Prestige ,The Illusionists have similar twists but their plot was set in the 19th century .This is a modern day period thriller cum heist movie .ï»¿"
the avenger's hulk...the detective pretend to catch the 4. But actually he is.......the eye.ï»¿
"I really liked this movie but the romance was very forced, and I think that the movie would've been better without it... otherwise, the plot was slightly decipherable, but still good.ï»¿"
10/10ï»¿
Great movie. Confusing but very funï»¿
"This movie was not worth the 10 bucks. It was just a typical wannabe mind-fuck movie with a cheesy and convenient twist. Nothing special, a movie about magic is stupid.ï»¿"
"I think you meant ""you"", ""meant"", ""you're"", and ""wrong"".ï»¿"

"I like The Illusionist and The Prestige. In fact, I have watched The Prestige a couple of times. As soon as the DVD is released, I'd instantly bought it and watch it more times than The Prestige.. In my opinion, the twist is simpler than The Prestige but they both are of the same qualities....!!!!!! Nice!!!!ï»¿"

"I will have to saayyy umm no lol. You will be amazed & amused because we aren't given a motive for their ""negative"" actions throughout the movie until the bitter end. Alot of people here are very ignorant & slow/closed minded. I enjoyed this film because I love movies that keep you wondering. You wil think certain characters are protagonists while others are antagonists but then you are shown everything in the end so you can make a solid determination yourself. :-) ï»¿"
"If you have to choose which movie to watch 1) Now you see me, 2) Hangover 3 3) After earth just for the hell of it. Which one will you choose? ï»¿"

dont. you'll waste your moneyï»¿
this movie was so fucking horrible that we walked out the theaters. so fucking stupid! after earth and tis... MAJOR FLOPï»¿
so are the magicians the antagonists(bad guys) in the movie? ï»¿
Probably my new favorite movieï»¿

"Saw it today.... LET ME TELL YOU IT IS A MINDFUCK. The cast is badass (Woody Harrelson delivers laughs, Dave Franco delivers sexy, Isla is real woman power), plot is a little complicated towards the end but the twists are worth it. The only compliant is that it should've told more about the magician's backgrounds, less on the Mark Ruffalo/Melenie Laurent storyline. Anyone feel like there could be a sequel if it continues to do well at the box office? The ending kinda left room for a sequel ï»¿"
ugh...where can i find this online? looks hypeï»¿

"Saw this movie...and I liked it.  I don't give a shit what most of the critics say about it.  It was pure escapism and one wild rollercoaster ride...something today's snobby movie critics don't appreciate anymore.ï»¿"

"this movie was kind of meh in some parts, but in the end it was pretty good. The ultimate twist was interesting. ï»¿"
"The movie is certainly worth a watch, but it should have focused more on the magicians. The Prestige is a better film about magicians, but this is also a good movie.ï»¿"
this was an amazing movie XD i must watch it againï»¿
Yeah the detective thats supposed to be investigating them is in on it the whole time....there saved you $15 no need to thank meï»¿

And don't get me wrong, I was quite excited by the premise, as laid out in the trailer, but this is one of the worst films I've seen â€“ and I've seen a lot. If you have a brain cell or two to rub together, this ain't the one, trust me.ï»¿"

"Please do refrain from spouting off nonsese. Just because you saw people handling playing cards, and engaging in illusion tricks, in the trailer, doesn't mean the movie is a mix of 21 and The Prestige. To say so is an insult to all three movies. ï»¿"

This movie was really good! I really liked it!ï»¿
"wooh morgan freemanï»¿"
Yeah.  Freeman is a BOSS in this movie!  ï»¿
"I disagree.  I found it to be paced very well to both keep from being confusing, and not suffer from any lull periods.  ï»¿"
"A movie like this is GOING to have mixed reviews because it rides heavy on the twists, and people's reactions to (and understanding of) the twists will vary.  It's not as complicated as something like Inception, but it doesn't hold your hand throughout either.  The dialogue is surprisingly really good, there are no real lulls in the movie, the tension ALWAYS builds, and you are legit on the EDGE of your seat as they approach the final twist!!   ï»¿"
"Looks good, but it's had mixed reviews. Other than Man of Steel and Great Gatsby, this looks like another good movie this summer. Been a bit lackluster with Iron Man 3 sucking and Star Trek seeming a bit 1 dimensional.ï»¿"
"This was good, but it had too many twistsï»¿"
This gave me chills!ï»¿
Actually it was really goodï»¿

This is an AMAZING movie. It's definitely one of my top favorite movies of all time. Everything about it was so well done. It had great actors and amazing visuals. This movie was an artistic masterpiece - a work of magic. I don't think there was anything bad about it.ï»¿
"It was good, but the first rule of magic is to never reveal your secret. :Pï»¿"
"I saw the special screening. Its all illusions and just tricks up their sleeves. One thing, be sure to pay attention to every specific details.ï»¿"
The ad for the movie came before the video. .--.ï»¿
"I count about One hundred rabbits,but not for sure the movie looks good can't wait to see it.!!!!!!!ï»¿"
Awesome movie! ï»¿
"The only trick I can't see being simply an illusion is the bank robbery itself. The guy was clearly teleported into the bank, and My Cocaine was actually robbed, so...ï»¿"
"Haymitch?  Really?  How about Woody Harrelson( Tallahassee- Zombieland, Carson Wells- No Country for Old Men, Woody Boyd- CHEERS)ï»¿"

"whats it ratedï»¿"
"If all of the ""tricks"" are just complicated illusions, this movie will be awesome. If they actually have magical powers, that sucks. You have to respect the art of illusion by keeping it an illusion.ï»¿"
"It's like Inception, Ocean's 11/12/13, and Italian Job. I bet Mark Ruffalo will be one of them in the end.ï»¿"
This is going to be my fav movieï»¿

"Guys, I've watched the movie yesterday, I'm Malaysian the movie releases yesterday.Ok the first things first, the movie is a fun-thrilled, blow minding scene, awesome magic tricks, instant sequences BUT, you have to watch the movie really focus (the closer you look, the less you actually see) because the movie is too much prick to know and the tricks has not yet been done to any movie or magician/conjuror except for this movie.SPOILER ALERT!: Jack didn't die and Dylan is the Fifth horsemen!ï»¿"

Is that debby Ryan ?ï»¿
"i feel like there is going to be a sequel called ""Now You Dont""ï»¿"
I cant wait to see this.ï»¿
Oh...My...GLOB! I want to see that movieï»¿
hopefully it is not predictableï»¿
First rule of magic always be the smartest guy in the roomï»¿
And Alfred don't forget Alfred.ï»¿
All seeing eye 1:43 lol I still think this movie is awesomeï»¿
MORGAN FREEMAN!!!!!ï»¿
"this looks pretty goodï»¿"
Michael Caine....ï»¿
Looks awesome!!ï»¿
Now you don'tï»¿
I hope this is.....goodï»¿
Ahahahah!!!!ï»¿
Now you see the tickets now you don't.ï»¿
"You forgot the most important one: Sir Michael Caine. AWESOME!!!ï»¿"
"I would assume so, but I wouldn't say that excuses himï»¿"
"open new tab,search Electric Joy Ride - 365 on youtube,mute this vid,start together.Enjoy.ï»¿"
he's probably a young person don't you think?ï»¿
You forgot Sir Michael Caine :Dï»¿
Isla Fisher is such a hottie.ï»¿
Is it just me or this video doesn't have 720p option? o.Oï»¿
"TAMW when hulk gets pissed ï»¿"
"So, you don't know the names of half of the characters they played, AND you left out Michael Caine?ï»¿"
Or will you?ï»¿
YOU DID NOT MENTION ALFRED PENNYWORTHï»¿
Dave Franco!!!! <3ï»¿
I saw this movie yesterday during a Sneak Preview and it really is an amazing movie. I highly advice you all to go and see it in cinema <3ï»¿
"dont forget Michael caine (batman trilogy ,The prestige, children of men)ï»¿"
"I really want to watch this movie.ï»¿"
I love magic tricksï»¿
reminds me of the prestige. not to mention there is one actor who played in that one ï»¿
1.06 i see ...ï»¿
you forgot Michael Caine (beloved Alfred Pennyworth)ï»¿
"what??you mean ""Run Boy, Run"" by Woodkidtree stump/10ï»¿"
You forgot about Michael Caine ( Batmans Butler) hes one hell of a butler you need him.ï»¿
"who going this friday to town east Amc movie teater ?ï»¿"
I cannot wait to see this movie lolï»¿
"So I just got back from the premier and i must say it was AMAZING!!!!!!ï»¿"
Brilliant plotï»¿
you forgot Batmans motha fucking butlerï»¿
Yep because we all know the best time to judge a movie is before it comes out. Flawless logic.ï»¿
"""Everyone in this room was a victim of hard times...Some of you lost your homes, your cars..."" Then how can they all afford the probably extremely expensive ticket prices of your show in Vegas. (Yes I checked, the first 40 seconds are in Vegas)ï»¿"
I am seeing this movieï»¿
You are forgetting alfred.ï»¿
Woody Harrelson(Tallahassee - Zombieland)ï»¿
"yep i agree. i am lucky to get my gift iphone 5 from youtube questionnaire for nothing. but i can tell you one thing, dont forget to give ur email id and delivery address to receive via courier. i found it here  >>> bit.ly/12LQaRT?=oopzjï»¿"
I hopevthos week flys by fast because on Friday I'm going to this movie!!!ï»¿
"so the guy in the hat is woody harrelson i wasn't sure.ï»¿"
And now you don'tï»¿
I'd see this just for MÃ©lanie Laurentï»¿
"I honestly don't see what's so great about this movie. All the illusion tricks are obviously cgi, so that takes away the ""wow factor"" or ""how did they do that?"" feeling. The whole premise just looks kind of stupid to me.And are people seriously going to pay for the film JUST because it has Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine in it? WOW....So basically, if you want to become a rich movie director, just put in the cast of Nolan's Batman trilogy with a crap story and watch your bank account riseï»¿"
"OKAY SO....Jesse Einsenberg(The creator of facebook - The Social Network), Mark Ruffalo(Hulk - The Avengers),Woody Harrelson(Haymitch - The Hunger Games), Isla Fisher(The Shopaholic), Dave Franco(Drug Dealer - 21 Jump Street), and Morgan Freeman(THE EVERYTHING) ? All in one movie?! THIS IS GOING TO BE ONE HELL OF A MOVIE!ï»¿"
Haters gonna hateï»¿
"I'm going to watch this movie tomorrow...I'm Malaysian so, the movie is coming tomorrow.. :p  Jealous much?...anyway, i've got a pair of free tickets to watch the movie!ï»¿"
They'll never pull off a trick as good as Andy Dufresne!ï»¿
Dope:)ï»¿
The film looks pretty interesting. Ä°m certainly gonna watch itï»¿
The thing is...there is no way this movie gonna have a resolution that actually won't be retarded.ï»¿
"the more hyped up the movie becomes, the more disappointing its going to be.ï»¿"
Nice but hahï»¿
Lol chillï»¿
"It upsets me how moronic everyone who commented on this is. ""Morgan Freeman and Zombielanders are in this film = OMGFG!!1! this is amazing!"" Fuck you. This movie looks terrible, with a pointless actiony plot. And come one, bringing Micheal Caine into another magician film?Fuck you.They made it solely to take the lent from your pockets, and that's why cinema is dead. You are all fucking idiots.ï»¿"
I'm gonna watch the fuck out of thisï»¿
"wow, i dont mind watching this in 3D. ï»¿"
"Most original, interesting and fun movie trailer I've seen in years.ï»¿"
This is gonna be awesome!!!!!!ï»¿

"That part where he switches the handcuffs and is like ""always be the smartest person in the room"" i'm like ""hell yeah man this movie's gonna be freakin' epic!"" ï»¿"
Wait Â´till Batman finds out they robbed his bank.... Alfred and Fox are also in trouble.ï»¿

"My Cocaineï»¿"
Are you forgetting Shosanna Dreyfus?!ï»¿
"This movie is fucking fuck fuck fuck awesome holy shit mother fucker ohh my god !!!! This is insane ï»¿"
Actually there're a lot of modificated comments which actually aim the same purpose. But they start with a slightly different words or trying to be natural comments... but always ends up with the ridiculous claimed URL. ï»¿
"Good Eye...!!ï»¿"

You couldn't have chosen a better username.ï»¿

Some of the best and most entertaining movies have messages.ï»¿
"I feel like I've watched the whole movie ..ï»¿"
Take that Penn and Teller!!!ï»¿
Looks greatï»¿
That snap change sucked. LOLï»¿
Mark Zuckerberg can't win The HULK with a fool magic trick to transfer his cuffs to him. You got no idea how angry he can be.ï»¿
Well I sincerely hope you bail then. ï»¿
@1:08 Very Mark Zuckerberg.ï»¿
Criss Angel certified.ï»¿
From one illusionist to another. Holy Shiiteï»¿
It looks awesome!ï»¿
"I'm guessing that the 'real' trick is that the bank wasn't actually robbed during the magic show, but it gets robbed later by Morgan Freeman's character, who is pretending to help the FBI and Michael Kain, but is actually orchestrating the whole thing.ï»¿"
"The movie is out in my country already. It has been since yesterday. I wasn't able to see it cause I went to see Fast 6, but it was there and it had very good reviews.ï»¿"
Dont make hulk madï»¿
i am going to watch this! Can't wait!ï»¿
"A movie like Inception had quite a cheerful and optimistic message. I like messages when they're subliminal and can only be grasped through deduction. Contrary to your opinion, I want this movie to have a message.ï»¿"
"So according to this movie, magic is real?ï»¿"
"Think, how do pirated copies of a movie hit the internet before they're even in theatres??? Some actor or worker on the set is not going ""Oh i'll just leak this to the public because i'm good hearted."" It's pirated from the screening. Most times.ï»¿"
I love Jesse!!!!ï»¿
wikipedia org/wiki/Film_screeningï»¿
Looks great. Hopefully it doesn't have a shit twist in the third act and a horrible ending.ï»¿
"I mean I suppose, but my comment was vague enough I think to not really be too revealing, and anyway I wouldn't really be gaining anything by lying about seeing a film. Also the cool trick I mentioned appears to already be on youtube so there's that. So yeah I mean believe what you want I don't really know why this upset you but it's ok.ï»¿"
"Ok well if he did, I'm sorry but I've never heard of this screening shit. Why would the let people see it before it's out??ï»¿"
Too bad he didn't know how to do this in 30 minutes or less.ï»¿
"how can anyone not like this trailer, it looks amazing!ï»¿"
"Yeah, cause noone will see it before the release date. Not even the actors or critics. Those dates are for the masses.ï»¿"
does anyone know the name of that trick ? 0:13ï»¿
This is totally inception mark II damnit it's a must-seeï»¿

"There are these things called ""screenings"" mate...ï»¿"

you do realize what the word SCREENING means right....ï»¿
"To me, it looks like it comes out on May 31... Looking at the date, we still have exactly a week to go... Good try, though.ï»¿"
I saw it last night at a screening as well..dont be an idiot. It is called a SCREENING for a reason. ï»¿
"It's not even out yet, we still have over a week till it's released stop pulling shit out your ass.ï»¿"
Awesomeï»¿
What's with the Prestige narration? ï»¿
0:18 Owwww!!! Lolï»¿
"Saw last night at a screening. Quite good, though not excellent. Others found it above-excellent, so that is my  distinct opinion, as my expectations were very high. VERY COOL trick in the opening, won't spoil it, but gave me goosebumps in the theatre. ï»¿"
Probably a pre-release screening. Check out Gofobo.comï»¿
As I was watching the advertisement it showed the now you see me commercial...ï»¿
yep that's me :Fï»¿
"Albert, God and Hulk high as fuck ï»¿"
"gawdddd, i cannot wait to watch this movieï»¿"

I was watching the advertisement before the video think that was the video (They were the same advertisment) XD Ahhhh the ironyï»¿
Looks amazing can't wait to see itï»¿

This is a MUST see movie. My birthday is June 5th so I'm going to see it for my birthday!ï»¿

"i have to watch this movieï»¿"
One of the coolest story concepts I've ever seenï»¿
I not going  to miss this movie I will watch this movie  ï»¿
"Or... maybe he did. Already read an article that said that they had several actual magicians on hand, and some of them taught the actors slight-of-hand tricks to use on camera.That's not to say there was NO editing used at all for certain tricks in this film, but based on that knowledge, the editing might not as prevalent as one would think it would be.ï»¿"
run boy run by woodkidï»¿
mr caine is in  The Prestige and here....wild...odd...interesting....would it be similar w/ greater special effects or better story/plot? But taken to las vegas...not far from hollywood? I doubt it would be good....hope I am wrong...ï»¿
Looks very cool. Can't wait !ï»¿
"...does anyone know the music playing at the end?ï»¿"
"Alfred, Morgan Freeman, The Hulk and Isla Fisher. Definitely gonna watch this film~ ï»¿"

"yea i do , cgiï»¿"
"THIS, THIS, ALL OF THIS. DAMMIT, HOLLYWOOD, I'M THIRSTING FOR CREATIVE NEW IDEAS FOR FILMS AND *THIS* IS WHAT I WANNA SEE MORE OF!ï»¿"
Considering this is a movie that uses the power of editing he probably didn't do an actual trick.  ï»¿
Run Boy Run - Woodkidï»¿
does anyone know how morgan freeman did the trick with disappearing dollar?ï»¿

Y Morgan freemen yyyyyyyï»¿
"yeah it does when you say it that way. But it actually makes sense when you say it like; ""Hey what're the titles of those badass magician movies with god and hulk in it?"" ""Now You See Me, Now You Don't."" ;)ï»¿"

"I agree with all of this.However,And this MAY be - because I just finished playing LoL....But...Shaco, Anyone? This movie just needs a crazy jester and it's perfect.ï»¿"
"Watch with a girl you like. In the movie say ""watch closely, no closer, nah a bit closer"" then you kiss her and she slap you.ï»¿"

"im an ellusionist so i need to see thisï»¿"
"That sounds brilliant, thoughï»¿"
"I see ""The Prestige"" mixed with ""Ocean's Eleven""ï»¿"
Finally something original in filmï»¿
"...Eh, Bruce Banner IS the Hulk so... your point?ï»¿"
"Just throwing my hat into the ring: Aliens. On a more serious note I amend my first statement. This isn't just Jumper meets The Prestige.This is Jumper meets Ocean's 11 meets The Prestige meets the ending to Swordfish.ï»¿"
This movie only seems good because Mel Gibson is narrating it.ï»¿
Yep this is on my movie grocery list.ï»¿
"MORGAN FREEMAN, lolï»¿"
More original than a lot of films Hollywood has produced.ï»¿
ORIGINAL? Sorry but this is Jumper meets The Prestige. Unless they really do something amazing it looks like it will be an entertaining and forgettable remake.ï»¿

I amazed and I don't have one bad thing to say about this movie it looks like a mind twister/adrenaline edge of your seat thrill ride. ï»¿
what song is at the end? :Oï»¿
This trailer reminds me a bit of The Prestige.ï»¿
This reminds me of Kaito Kid from Case Closed a lot LOL Awesomeï»¿

"As a magician, this is a total insult.ï»¿"
i see one eye :Oï»¿
I have been waiting for a movie like this!!! it looks awesome!!!ï»¿
Looks interesting but the only problem I have is that when CGI is used to do the magic then it literally IS magic... computer magic. The only way for the magic trick to be effective is if it is an actual trick. However since most of the magic in this movie is CGI then it could never happen and it will remain impossible. Sort of defeats the purpose of a movie that is saying everything that is happening is a trick and not magic when in fact it is magic...ï»¿
0:14 HAHA DAVID BLAINE COULD DO DATï»¿
"OMG, I NEED TO SEE THIS! Always loved magic tricks and magicians. ï»¿"
"Ofcourse not, why would they put the end in a trailer? They aren't stupid.ï»¿"

why rob a bank and give the money back? so you basically stealing from people and then giving back to other people. ï»¿
By robbing Bruce Wayne's money and now Alfred and Mr.Fox will find and kill themï»¿
"You need to look carefully at that film again, man. Irish Cowboy is partially right. Eisenberg was INDEED from the film ""Social Network,"" NOT Michael Cera. (I don't agree with that guy's dissing of this movie is all.)Eisenberg and Cera are constantly mistaken by audiences as looking alike.ï»¿"
So when does the hulk come out? :Dï»¿
Then a hulk Easter eggï»¿

Also, movies like Now you see it weren't even shown in theaters...they were just disney channel specials...ï»¿"
I have seen the old movie(3 times lol) and that movie have nothing to do with this. The characters from that one is not even in this one. None of them are. This is not a sequel just cuz the its almost the same title. ï»¿
That was obviously a joke? ï»¿
"Maybe because of a little thing i call coincidence. :D And also, even though I don't no much about disney I know a lot about movies and the fact the this movie is not being made by disney and there was never any announcement that they were selling this franchise, mixed with the fact that it has a plot that seemingly takes itself seriously implying it has no ties with disney meaning it is not a seqeul in any way.ï»¿"
"Oh my god, I opened this page and the commercial came up, you know? So it starts and it's the Now You See Me trailer...is that movie trailerception?ï»¿"

Well there are a lot of people in Hollywood and the movie-making industry who thinks differently from you. And let's not talk about the millions people (fans) who think differently from you. So my guess is you represent a very small number and guess what.... none of those people are listening to you.  ï»¿

Guys...I know what the real trick is. They're making you think that they're dealing with people and the people are actually zombies. Everything you see besides Tallahassee & Columbus is false.ï»¿
"I highly doubt it will be better than the Prestige (because that movie was phenomenal), but it certainly has me interested.ï»¿"

"I'm sorry I meant, Jessy Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson in the same movie once again, this movie is gonna be kickass wicked over-the-hill insanely awesome. Fuck yeah!ï»¿"
"Jesse Eisenberg, fuck yeah, this movie is gonna be awesome.ï»¿"
SO EXCITEDï»¿
I know Chris Angel is pissed right now !!!!!!ï»¿
This Looks ammmazing !!!!!!!!ï»¿
"so this is what Alfred & Lucius did after Bruce faked his death, one became a banker and the other became a magician, Tallahassee & Columbus (became a badass) also defeated the zombie outbreak and became magician/thief.. Banner became an FBI agent, better not make him angry, you wont like it when he's angry..ï»¿"
They better be careful not to make Bruce Banner Hulk-out! ï»¿
"oh shit tallahassee and columbus actully found a cure to all the zombies and became magicansOH SHIT THIS MOVIE IS GONNA BE EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ï»¿"
I'm guessing Tallahassee and Columbus discovered magic and ended the zombie apocalypse. ï»¿
"Maybe, just maybe I would actually own a phone book, On the off chance that morgan freeman would sign it, I would finally have the incentive to have children of my own to listen to the soundtrack before they go to bed every night.

Notice they said four horsemen ? Isn't that from the bible ? Aren't they the devils reapers ?ï»¿
IT'S A MOVIE! And it has nothing to do with that particular trick. Now be quiet and enjoy the trailer.ï»¿
that quote must be homage of Prestige...ï»¿
Morgan Freeman could read a fucking phone-book for 2 hours and I'd still pay to see it....twice.ï»¿

Hmmm....The Prestige anyone?ï»¿
"Watch South Park, don't you?ï»¿"
"True. However, according to the production team, they hired real magic/illusion consultants to teach the cast some basic tricks to do on-screen. CG is only used on the most complex, difficult-to-accomplish, real-life scenes.ï»¿"
yeah i really hope  they are illusionists and not  magicians the movie will be awesome if there is nothing supernatural in itï»¿
...stupid.ï»¿
Why doesn't Alfred just call batman and let him know Lucius is evil now?ï»¿

God damn this looks awesome.ï»¿
wow.ï»¿
dafuq!!ï»¿
you're saying that as if you can only watch one movie... ever. Why not both?ï»¿
Is it just me or did Eisenberg seem like he just reprise his role as Mark Zuckerberg in this movie; someone that exudes self-confidence that is borderline arrogance? Not that I'm complaining.ï»¿
or it's just normal sleight of hand and tricks..ï»¿
Woah woah woah... let's not get ahead of ourselves.ï»¿

"Can't even think about having a sequel of The Prestige without Chris Nolan's collaboration in it. BTW. i think it's not a sequel and also no magic movies can touch the levels of The Prestige, coz Prestige is not a magic movie, it's a mindbombing movie.ï»¿"
1:42 illuminati in the blue lighting ï»¿
If this isnt real magic then ..Lemme guess ... Ruffalo was the part of the team all along.ï»¿
I'm not going to say it was aliens.... but it was aliens.ï»¿
Cant waitï»¿
ALIENS.ï»¿
"its like a sequel to the ""The Prestige"" movie. Michael Caine was in that movie to ï»¿"
That red head is hottï»¿
I will be really disappointed if their explanation for how they do what they do is real magic. ï»¿
Can't decide if this is a realistic movie about some crazy good magicians..or if they're flipping it to make them ACTUALLY having magic abilities. Also can't decide if the latter would ruin the movie or make it more epic. ï»¿
run boy run- woodkidï»¿
MORGAN FREEMAN!!!!!!ï»¿

Wanna see so bad :Dï»¿
May seem to be a good month. Lots of movies coming out that monthï»¿
