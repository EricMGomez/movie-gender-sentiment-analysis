Are they making another one? To show what happens to Adam and Miaï»¿
Worst ending. Amazing sad movieï»¿
this was the most saddest and most touching movie Iâ€™ve ever watched. I thought it would be like cheesy but when I actually watched it and can I just say Iâ€™ve never cried so much. I cried tears of sadness and joy and literally Iâ€™m shaking and crying about how good this is. 10/10 recommendï»¿
"Damn the ending of this movie :(this is a trailer im not dumb i watched the movie i meant NOT THISï»¿"

"God, who cut the onions!?ï»¿"
Whats the first song of the trailer ?!?!?!ï»¿
"i crying...when it was white i started feeling she's going to make it.. she woke up.. and then it ended and all i could do is cry i don't know what happens next. and I went straight to youtube and wrote ''if i stay 2''  nothing.. so i clicked here just to write this down.. i want a part two so bad.. i need to know whats going to happen with her? Does she have any medical problems?whos going to be her orphanage family? is she still with him? is her best friend happy? is her brother alive? does she miss her father and mom? does she remember what she saw? I have SO MANY questions that need to be solved for me.I think this movie is very sad and romantic so i suggest you watch it and remember how life is special to every single one of uswe were born to live our lives and enjoy and appreciate who were we supposed to be, some people dont appreciate what  they are given but you have to because you only live once and you cant go back in time either way you want to or not... you dont need change anything about you there is something special about everyone of us.I Peyton appreciate what has given and what im going true, is in the past all of the bulling i got true just because i had someone who cared and loved me for me.At first, i didn't really understand the movie until i got to the middle and i paused and started crying of course cause i realized shes dreaming of the stuff she did while she was alive and healthy and in love i cried of course.. everyone did.ï»¿"
i need the season 2 of this.ï»¿
"Honest opinion - This movie is boring... too much talking and boring background song and 1000 unnecessary kisses. Although you guys may like it but for me this was waste of timeï»¿"
I WANT TO WATCH IT WHERE CAN I WATCH IT GOSHHHH I WANT IT SO BAD âù_ï¸èâù_ï¸èï»¿

Do cursed child !!!ï»¿
I cried so hard when the best friend came in to talk to her. Couldnâ€™t hold back the tears anymoreï»¿

I'm in love with a non-existing band _Ÿ˜_ï»¿
"this movie is so good but...SPOILER ALERT:She wakes up at the end, and then the movie end...so disappointedï»¿"
The book is so boring she just talks about pancakes and her boyfriend and boring stuff. I haven't seen the movie so I can't judge but the movie looks better then the book was.ï»¿
im watching this trailer and then i saw this on the tvï»¿
This is the best movie I have ever seen. Everything about it was amazing. I have never cried so much during a movie. The ideas behind every seen are deep..... I recomend watching itï»¿

"wow, this has already been said but this movie took me on a journey of self discovery and revealed to me emotions that i thought i never had. Some parts of the movie i closed my eyes but words alone still held me in an emotional daze and tears slowly poured down my cheeks. This movie is a really good movie, it's a gem that you will appreciate after watching.ï»¿"
SAY SOMETHING IM GIVING UP ON POO _Ÿ’© WHAT IS THIS ABOUT??? PEOPLES I WANT TO WATCH IT BUT I NEED TO KNOW WHAT ITZ ABOUï»¿
Can anyone tell me something about the book i mean the sequelï»¿
I give this movie a 10/10.ï»¿
Went to go see this movie at the movie theaters and I was very disappointed in it. This movie wasn't what I thought it was at all. I thought it was way too boring and I thought they just drag everything out way too long. It took almost pretty much forever to get over and done with. I'm just being very open and honest. The truth and nothing but the truth. This is one movie I did not like or enjoyed at all.ï»¿
Read the book_Ÿ˜©ï»¿
deleteï»¿
"That's one of the saddest movies I have ever watched. The song is emotional, people in mobie cry, most of time she is choosing between death and staying alive. I cried the most when her grandpa talked to her_Ÿ˜¢ Really the saddest but the best movie ever. 11/10ï»¿"
"I'm so confused, because both the girls look the sameï»¿"
Such a great movie but the ending _Ÿ™„ï»¿
Amagazine and special movieï»¿
I cried and laughed the entire movie it's simply great this is my favourite movieï»¿
i dont understand why they didnt make the sequel of the book.ï»¿
I remember 4 years ago constantly seeing this trailer playing on TV. I hated it cause I though it was gonna be horror or some really sad movie. I watched it today finally and may I say that movie took a piece of me and threw it in the trash. The ending when she opened her eyes and it just cut to credits I can't even. I held back so many tears. 10/10 a beautiful story it needs a part two.ï»¿
"well,. they could make a symphonic metal band.ï»¿"
who came here from kkandbabyj _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚âù_ï¸èâù_ï¸èï»¿
Totally a movie you can watch on a sleepover with your best friends *caution tissues and snacks are neededï»¿
Still best movie ever madeï»¿
Desde poco me gusta Chile y por eso no vi la pelÃ_cula pero con el trailer tengo el derecho a decir que esa pelÃ_cula es muy buena ella es una de mis actoras favoritas y tiene un gran talentoï»¿
This trailer is so confusingï»¿
it was an Ok movie...I was expecting much more of it...they focus too much on the romantic part of it leaving to the side the accident family tc etc......ï»¿

Can someone nuke this trailer.ï»¿
"This might be the only time in my entire life where I can say with full confidence that a movie is more perfect than the book. The movie captures some sort of elegance and beauty that the book lacks, and I can say with certainty that the movie actually has a whole place in my heart, so much more so than the book ever had. It's that beautiful.ï»¿"

"Anyone else just become ""stuck"" after they've watched this? I only started watching movies with Chloe in them just over a month ago and ended up really liking her (even though I'd seen a few movies with her in them before that). Now after watching this I feel like I have no idea what to do lol.ï»¿"
Idk how many times I've watched that movie but it's my favorite movie yet. _Ÿ‘ç_Ÿè»ï»¿
the book is as beautifully amazing n sizzling with imotions as the movieï»¿

I WANT A GUY LIKE ADAMMMMMMMMMMMM....ï»¿
THIS IS A MUST WATCH. THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER. Also watch a walk to remember and flipped..... You're welcome ï»¿
"This one bored me halfway through the movie. Chloe plays a quirky and predictable teenage girl which is going to get laid by tomorrow. The only good parts are in the trailer till 1:00 and the part where she wakes up to find out she is dying. This movie goes to show how actors can truly mess up some characters that are meant to be absolutely vital to the story. This was just a paycheck for most of the people involved. I really didn't feel it, take my advice and don't waste your time. However, this one really needs a remake. The movies are only focused on teenage girls taken the fact that the boyfriend in the movie is basically kissing material. And Stefan Teunissen, you cried, really? Go watch Shindler's List and if you don't cry to that, the odds are that you are full of shiï»¿"
saw the movie and it was heart breaking. even the trailer made me tear upï»¿
IS This smiliar to Before i Fall ?ï»¿
"They totally ruined quite a good novel. The movie could have been much much better.ï»¿"
"this was favorite book for such a long time, and this movie did it justice. thank you.ï»¿"
"After watching this movie, it really touched my heart and i cried the whole time. Its really worth watching.ï»¿"
I lost my dad and baby brother in a crash... so I can relate. maybe that's why I cry every time I watch thisï»¿

Adam is so so  so so bad actor.ï»¿
"They better make the second book into a movie, I swear!!!!""If I Stay"" was incredibly well performed and brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion, pulling my heartstrings at every scene. I heard that there was actually a lot of backlash for this movie, (when nearly dying after an argument with a boy the character is in love with, basically changes his entire world for her, and/or begs her to come back to him. The character wakes up and then ""they live happily ever after."") Although in the second book, ""Where She Went"" describes three years after Mia's car accident and how everything had drastically changed. It's more of a realistic view and it's really good!!!ï»¿"
Please someone tell me what is the song at 00:13ï»¿
"Pedro Saulo Vasconcelos Rodrigues If you find it tell me, I've been looking for it.. please! _Ÿ™èï»¿"

This teenage girl got into a car accident with some friends went into a coma and the parents were on there way to see her, and got into a car accident and both passed away in the accident.

Honestly so disappointing. She opened her eyes at the end. Then that it. Really?!?! I was expecting more. What a let down.ï»¿
Everything about this movie makes my heart sink but I âù_ï¸èLOVE âù_ï¸è Chloe Grace Mortez and this movie!MAKE WHERE SHE WENT A MOVIE!!!plz!ï»¿

Emily Hope thankss ! _Ÿ˜_ï»¿
Haha here's an evil side. What if: (not including books cuz I didn't read it) Adam singing at the end was a trap to pull Mia in back into her body. Hence the scary music and the flashbacks! And now she has to live when she really wanted to die!!! _Ÿ˜ˆ but I like to think she chose to live for love.ï»¿

Manatee()5 ikr my friend said the book was boring and I was like FIGHT MEï»¿
Manatee()5 definitely.ï»¿
"I completely agree. I was actually annoyed watching the movie because they changed so much. I get that there's things they have to cut (so the movie isn't 5 hours long) or change (for charity purposes), but they cut/changed...a lot. They took her search for Teddy and turned it into ""yay he's alive...oops nvm"" and then made it all about Adamï»¿"
I hope they make a second movie to the seriesï»¿
probably one of  the best movies i ever saw and the only one that made me literally cry...ï»¿

"So on August 29th, 2016- Sunday I started to read the ""If I Stay"" Book because me Speech-Therapist wanted to read it this Summer because I have Autism and I have trouble picturing things when I read (I usually WATCH the Movie FIRST then READ the Book SECOND because that helps me picture things whilst I read and it makes sense to me. But me Speech-Therapist said to READ the Book FIRST then WATCH the Movie SECOND... So I did that. But I still had trouble picturing things.)... Then today August 31st, 2016- Wednesday I finally finished reading the ""If I Stay"" Book and I NEVER cried whilst reading the Book. After reading the Book... I watched the Movie which was good that I rated it 3/5 Stars. But I was really disappointed because the Movie didn't have the same gloried bits in the Book in the Movie itself... For example... Adam creating a distraction by Brooke Vega and other things. Less Teddy in the Movie. Serious Kim in the Movie. I could say that the Book was much better than the Movie! _Ÿ˜ç_Ÿ˜ç_Ÿ˜ç Now me watching this Video... It makes me want to read the Sequel! _Ÿ˜±_Ÿ˜±_Ÿ˜± So I am still deciding if I should read it or not... I need help... ï»¿"
Is this the sequel to `Let Me In'?ï»¿
Is this movie worth watching?ï»¿
omg yeess..it's the best movie ever_Ÿ˜__Ÿ˜çï»¿
I've seen itt! I love the movie but the ending was kinda dissapointingï»¿
Amazing movieï»¿

Denisa Mihaela yes its an animeï»¿
"Read the book first around 2 years ago, 3/5 kinda annoying book but enjoyable if you're boring, the movie is a way more cheesy but also enjoyable and its less about other irrelevant characters, the only that bothers me is Chloe, her acting is painful to watch.ï»¿"
"God, that was the most amazing movie ever! I totally recommend it! It really fucked my feelings! I'm literally crying! YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT! It makes you see some things from a whole 'nother level. You'll understand why, if you watch it! ;)ï»¿"

it doesn't give me the same intense emotion like the book. The book was everything.ï»¿
You need to know that in the bible. When you die you don't become a ghost nor an angel and go to heaven lol.... You lose all your self all you are .your loved ones everything. Your will. You don't feel the passage of time. Nor do you see the living . Only the trust and belief of Jesus Christ son of god and savior of mankind from this world of sin will resurrect you to an eternal life  or eternal suffering.ï»¿
The song with the piano is named 'say something'ï»¿
brooklyn was mad when he saw this movie lolï»¿
"I feel like people really need to watch the movie to understand how sad it is. I cry about everything, but I got a headache from crying so much from watching this. It isnt just a love story. It's about her family. And that's the parts you're going to mainly cry about. Hence the end with her boyfriend. Which I was half crying, half disappointed.ï»¿"

"Chloe's acting was pretty good. As for the others, I can't say the same. As to why she didn't sob and cry, you have to understand that she's in an ethereal form. Besides, that's how it was directed and narrated: to not cry so much. It isn't her fault lolï»¿"
"I didn't cry either, but it left me feeling kind of depressed.ï»¿"

"I finally saw this move recently.Â Even thoughÂ I had been looking forward to seeing it for a long time,Â I did not expect to love it as much as I did. I know that Chloe Grace MoretzÂ isn't going to read this, but I wish I could tell her how moved I was by her performance. The best thing you can say about a movie is that the characters became real for you. Chloe did that for me.ï»¿"

Really a beautiful movie. I cried so hard. It was all really deep <3 and I loved the sudden ending. It all came down to her one decision and it ended with the viewers seeing her final choice :)ï»¿
No matter how this movie will end it'll still make you cry. Now she wakes up and it'll still make you cry. If she'll be dead you will cry then too. Like you have no changeï»¿

I've read the book and its sequel Where She Went and loved both books. I understand producing a movie from a book is difficult as the producer must meet the expectations of the readers but I was completely happy with the movie.

Watching this on prime right now. Not bad so far. And the boyfriend....wow. I imagine if Brandon Bruce Lee hadn't tragically died so young he would have had a kid that looked just like this guy. The resemblance is uncanny. If he hasn't heard that before I would be shocked. It's a little eerie. Didn't care for any of the crow movies following the original but he should audition.ï»¿

"I'm a picky 34-year-old film-buff, and despite the warnings of a ""cut too short and suddenly"" ending (which really deterred me, btw), I decided to venture into it anyway, expecting a somewhat sappy, guiltily gratuitous, generic teen flick. I was wrong. This movie truly moved me; there are still tears drying on my face. The first third is rather generic, but not in an entirely unpleasant way. The momentum picks up from there, and continues to accelerate, all the way until the end. It's engaging, charming, thought-provoking, and invokes an extreme range of genuine emotions. I would definitely recommend.ï»¿"

"Ah nothing like romantic propaganda, all kinds of repetitive and unoriginal.ï»¿"
"I'm not into cliche teen love stories at all. But this one was so great, it's now my favorite movie. I love how it revolves around music and how life can be so mysterious. I literally cried like a baby the whole time, and that's saying a lot for someone who never cries for a movie. I give it 15 out of 10 stars. c':ï»¿"
I hope 'where she went' (the sequel) gets filmed too bc that book is the shitï»¿
