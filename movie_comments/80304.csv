The biggest international motion picture of all timeï»¿
One of those purposely cheesy comedies that only some can appreciate. One of my favorite will ferrell movies.ï»¿
This movie has some good jokes but sucks ass. Really boring and exageratedï»¿
LOL I thought this was some kind of sketch but it isntï»¿
I think french is easier to speak but hard to understand...while Spanish easier to understand harder to speak...coming from someone who had English German and French at school while speaking Dutch and Serbian at home _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
Pinche pelÃ_cula oribleï»¿

"Looking back on this, I'm disappointed with Will Ferrell for doing thisï»¿"
whyï»¿
Do you speak american hahaha I love that!!!ï»¿
"Why is every movie from Gary Sanchez Productions, including Step Brothers and Hansel And Gretel: Witch Hunters, so stupid? At least films from Happy Madison Productions had class and better jokes! They have movies that are more watchable. Adam Sandler is more like a saint compared to a pervert like Will Ferrell.ï»¿"

"Its ""couldn't"". ""I couldn't give two shits...."" Commonly misused by those who don't think before they speak or write some sort of bullshit. It just sucks. I know your way of thinking out numbers mine in this world... I hope im there filming the day some mexican gets balls deep in your daughters ass while she moans ""its yours papi"" - sincerely yours -A.Moss (Google me bitch) -Kill Ya'self-ï»¿"
"Search ""A.Moss"" on you tube...ï»¿"
"@maggotbroth damn cuz- semi pro wasnt his best but just the ""sexy"" song was worth the view lol...you on some other shit with the hispanic stereotypes bra. To each is own, but I would suggest you find a better approach to embracing the culture melting pot we call ""Home""ï»¿"
"Maaaaan, I dont know about this. Maybe a bad trailer... I cant imagine a W.F. Movie flopping tho...ï»¿"
