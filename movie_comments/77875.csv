Are americans bored with their own sports to speak about football (soccer) ?? we are so used to watch their baseball or american football background stories. Unfortunately it doesn't impact on the (bad) quality of the movie...ï»¿
"Gerard Butler supports Celtic. Also they are one of the biggest football clubs in the world. You have no argument, goodbye.ï»¿"
@tdcpm27 .. whats wrong with celtic like? they are one of the biggest clubs in the world you fucking inbreeded fuck. take your unwanted comments else where!ï»¿

"It appears you are winning the idiot game. Celtic changed from a private limited company to a public limited company in 1994,the private limited company founded in 1897 was NOT LIQUIDATED. That company (1897) had all history pre 1897,because before that year,Celtic were not a company. This is a similar situation to Rangers when they founded their company in 1899. However,Rangers' company WAS LIQUIDATED. The club,was the company. Liquidated club - new company,new club. Even if RFC say different!ï»¿"
"Nice deflection there, teflon boy - I'd expect nothing less from you. Let's just body swerve that wee bit of egg on the face and skate on to the next bit of drivel. I'll be sure to toast you and your ilk when you're lifting the Holy Grail of Buckfast after another glorious CL campaign of abject humiliation. In the meantime, I have much better things to do than argue with an idiot, so I'll leave you in peace to tend to that throbbing head vein.  Cheerio and have a lovely life.ï»¿"
"Well, if you insist on playing this idiotic game, my friend, I'll gladly take up your double standards challenge:Pacific Shelf 595: Winners of the now defunct ""European Cup"" 1967 (you have heard of the Champions League, I take it?). ï»¿"
"Not nearly as tragic as the blatantly obvious campaign of hatred that has been waged from Torbett Towers in recent months. And as far as RFC goes, hardly a defunct club; different company ownership now but same football club, same 140 year history, in spite of the desperate wishes of CFC's rabid and (judging from available evidence) intellectually challenged hordes. After all, you lot at Pacific Shelf 595 should know all about that, no?ï»¿"
"They've exposed themselves over the last 12 months. Every phone in outside this country that has discussed Rangers troubles these last few months have remarked, above all, on the bitterness and joyful glee they showed at the thought of people being put on the dole over a game of football. They haven't shamed this country, they have shamed themselves. Fuck me the Irish cant even stand them either haha.ï»¿"
"Oh aye, Hibs circa late 1800 called, they want the history you stole from them back.ï»¿"
"Is our greatest manager denied a place upon our board for being not being a Protestant? Nope. But yours was denied a place on the Celtic board for being a Protestant, or more to the point, not a Catholic.For anyone watching in. The tims love the Nazis and in perticular their propaganda tactics. ANYTHING they do, they accuse others of doing, so much so, that they do it over and over and over and for the un-intelligent among us, it works.ï»¿"
"Timmy myths 101 right here.Rangers were founded by four men who saw a game being played across the Clyde and decided to start a football club. No-one was excluded, in fact, some of the early players were brought over from Belfast Celtic. You want the extensive list of names of Catholic players that Rangers have signed BEFORE Mo-Jo? The same Mo-Jo who had to the immigrate from his country of birth over fears for his life.....all because he signed for Rangers. Another blotch on Celtics history.ï»¿"
"Make that ""Remembrance Day"". Sorry for the typo...ï»¿"
True that. And continually disrespecting the minute's silence for the war dead on Rememberance Day. And on and on. Glass houses and all that. ;-)ï»¿
"Aye, right. KKK, eh? What planet are you from again? Tell that to Mark Walters, who had to endure a torrent of monkey chants and thrown bananas when he made his Rangers debut against Celtic at Celtic Park on 2 January, 1988.ï»¿"
You forgot fueling Nazi U-boats and aiding downed Luftwaffe pilots.ï»¿
Ha!  So true.  Fuck the knuckledraggers.ï»¿
"Single dad and single mom fall in love, there's a problem which could mean no love, problem goes away, the live happily ever after.Think I've seen this before.ï»¿"
"Oh aye, universally loved. For shielding child molesters, throwing bananas at black players, glorifying terrorists... &c &c &c. The saintly untouchables that never put a foot out of line - or so their well-oiled Ministry of Propoganda would have the world believe with it's credo of ""Repeat the lies often enough and they're eventually accepted as truth."" Legends in your own Simple Minds.ï»¿"
"isn't he the coolest for letting the kid drive the ferrari? :)ï»¿"
"...till the life juice weeps!ï»¿"
Yup Spartan surfing soccer players are always getting the Uma Zeta Biels...ï»¿
"But you said lately which suggests that you believe he hasn't had a 'masculine' role for years. And that film was released last year, slow ass.ï»¿"
DENNIS QUAID IS HERE!ï»¿
Passï»¿
Maybe the Huns will get Andy Cameron to represent Newco 2012 in a film LMAO.ï»¿
did he play a bitch in that movie just like this trailer is showing?NO! get the drift or move on slow assï»¿
"Machine Gun Preacher was just released last year. And both of those films sucked. Coriolanus was good, though.ï»¿"
Didn't I just watch a trailer where Gerard Butler was a surfer just a few days ago? Huh ...ï»¿
"don't worry I'll send you a crate of them.ï»¿"
"This is funny, because Gerard isnt actually that good at footbalï»¿"
This film looks like the absolute pits. ï»¿
"Get a life you fucking loser, I mean, it's not as if they're going to use a third division team for a Hollywood movie (assuming that's who you support) FUCK THE HUNS.ï»¿"
"I've seen him play football, he's shite :(ï»¿"
Nice to see the old Roman Catholic Smith tops back :)ï»¿
Division 3.  LOL.ï»¿
"I'm quite sure it's the once Rangers FC who found it repulsive to even consider signing someone who wasn't white and protestant. Celtic are unanimously loved because we show a degree of patience in putting up with your inbred and backward ways, with our patience recently being rewarded, enjoy your park benches. YNWA. ï»¿"
"This is the kind of crap reply expected from someone who supports a diddy team, pure jealousy is all it isï»¿"
"Celtic Glasgow!ï»¿"
the yester year hotties ganged up i guess.. ï»¿
using a the beautiful game to make a crappy movie..ï»¿

What music is at the end of the trailer?ï»¿
catherine zeta jone???!!!!! she's still acting??!!ï»¿
Football*ï»¿
"It can not be said to please everyone. To me if I liked it because it is the more I like Gerry, sensitive man but I also like the warrior and the tough. I suggest that if there will be another trailer has more comic gags as it is romantic comedy. I don't seemed to long for me so this very well but all opinions are respectable.ï»¿"
trailer tells it all.. :|ï»¿
gotta see itï»¿
What a waste of a great castï»¿
This movie is not about the future of ex Celtic players but more closer to the future of current Rangers playersï»¿
I can predict the whole movie just by looking at this trailer.ï»¿
Its  FOOTBALL not soccer ï»¿
"this actually looks like a good movie so stop hating, i know we have our own opinions but come onï»¿"
Este Video esta sensacional o filme vai ser o maior sucesso quero ver gerry na telona do cinema bjs vevete!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ï»¿
This is all you have to do with your lives?  Piss on a trailer?  Soooooo sad........ï»¿
Seems like a typical story of a divorced mom and dad and a kid the mom is going to remarry but the kid doesn't like the new dad and eventually the original mom and dad end up together. and the rest of the story doesn't seem original either. Just a regular plot adapted for soccer.ï»¿
"No need to watch the film, we all know everything that happens. Good job.ï»¿"
This movie like Californication.ï»¿
I think i watched the whole movie with this trailer.ï»¿
pretty lame im sure no one will go see this ..ï»¿
Someone give gerard butler his testicles backï»¿
They're only native to the Philippines but some have been spotted in Australia. ï»¿
Anyone else got the feeling this trailer is way too long?ï»¿
I just seen the whole movie in two minutes.ï»¿
It's so funny because I was just telling my friend that I really want to see a horrible movie and then this happens!ï»¿

another cliche ï»¿
"why is butler taking girly roles lately, somebody inject him 50000g of T and bring him back to 300 level, machine gun preacher level, law abiding citzen level ï»¿"
"thats the whole movie, pretty muchï»¿"
