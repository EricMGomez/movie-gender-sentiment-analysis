"For all you Haters, I take it you were not even alive when this came out, it was 1980 and this was not to be a SERIOUS movie it was meant to be CAMPYï»¿"
I got AIDS watching this.ï»¿
Wow You should see your doctor about that as its IMPOSSIBLE to get AIDS from watching a trailer.ï»¿
What was the review I heard that one time â€œyou canâ€™t stop the music but you can stop this movieâ€ùï»¿
The Village People are to disco what the Beatles are to popular music. LOLï»¿
"I used to watch The Village People and wonder ""What must their wives and girlfriends be thinking?"" O.O not a clue.ï»¿"
Nothing as they were not married or have girlfriends.ï»¿
I think they're gayï»¿
"""Once you see it, you'll know why you......can't stop......HEAVING.""ï»¿"
"you can't stop Catrina, nobody can stop Catrina.ï»¿"
hi my name's catrina!ï»¿
"Geez Louise I can't believe Bruce Jenner either.   This is a good movie & good music too.._Ÿ’ƒ_Ÿè»_Ÿ___Ÿ’_ï»¿"
"Watch this movie and then Xanadu. You will quickly see that every background player in Can't Stop is anchored in a character, and that every scene is grounded in a reality. In Xanadu, the LEAD actors don't even believe what they are doing!ï»¿"
"Haaaaahahaha, so this explain Caitlin Jenner.ï»¿"
This movie is rainbow unicorns dipped in glitter gay!ï»¿
with a spliff made from multocoloured rezzlar paper.ï»¿
and a fluffy white coat and gogglesï»¿
"Wait, i don't get it.Can i stop the music or not?ï»¿"
Nobody can stop the music.ï»¿
"Yes you can. you must.ï»¿"
estuvo muy buena la pelÃ_cula me encantÃ_ maravillosaï»¿
H/T to HDTGM?ï»¿
"I love the disco music, but the movie itself is so oddly weird & embarrassing that it makes Xanadu look like a great movieï»¿"
The woman at 1:29 looks like Dr. Frank-N-Furter from Rocky Horror Pictures Show! LOL. At least Steve Guttenberg's career survived enough to do Cocoon and Police Academyï»¿
+Hardtechnoboy She can play with my bratwurst any old time.ï»¿
exelent â˜ºï»¿
No.  Please.  Try stopping the music.ï»¿
"Back in the day the ignorantÂ  majority thought this was some kind of fun Disney type popgroup for kids, but these guys were sucking serious dick back then people. Ow look, it's even got dear Caitlyn in it.ï»¿"
"+Holidayin germany  the 80s, the gay decade, so beautifulï»¿"
"Ok Music, Dreadful Movie...ï»¿"
wth it has good music and it is a good movie you are dreadfulï»¿
"Allan Carr just tried to capitalize from the success of Grease; when he realized that what sold Grease was mostly the OST, then he made this ... thing, and figured ""as long as they like the music, who cares about the story"" lol. Man, even Thank God It's Friday was a better movie than this, and TGIF has zero story.ï»¿"
"You mean, ""Starring CATILYN Jenner!""ï»¿"
"This is the gayest  film I've ever seen !!!!! I don't know if there are any other film that is this campy and fabulous,  then this film ï»¿"
then why are you watching the tralierï»¿
"have you seen ""zanadu""ï»¿"
Steve Dahl's Disco Demolition DID Stop The Music ... â™£ï»¿
"I love this movie - no lie, it may not be Oscar material but it is entertaining ï»¿"
"""Can't stop the laughter""... you can't stop what never started.ï»¿"
"it's absolutely fantastic, and directed by Nancy walker of Rhoda fame also !! No wonder it's a really camp OTT adventureï»¿"
I...just...wait...what was that again?ï»¿
So fucking brutal.ï»¿
I am betting that there are gay porno films that are less gay than this movie. A true classic.ï»¿
"Love the musicBruce Jenner was very funnyï»¿"
did everyone else at the time realise this was gay as all get out?! ï»¿
Neutronstar Neko I kind a new but I wasnâ€™t enough to know what that was but then somebody explained it to me so I was kind a like oh OK got it nowï»¿
Nothing like a bright pink Native American chief costume with glitter...ï»¿
"Ah, this is one of the two cinematic MESSTERPIECES that inspired THE RAZZIES!ï»¿"
"@Joseph Bacon I have a number of favorite films, and most of them are good, serious art. Â However, there's also a place for Howard The Duck, Eyes Of Laura Mars and Can't Stop The Music on the Favorites list.  That isn't a problem.  When a ""bad"" movie appeals to me, I don't ruin it for myself by pondering the fact that it doesn't fit the definition of a good film. Â When Village People appeared on Soul Train in 1980 to sing the title song and promote the film, Glenn Hughes was very clear about advising the audience to look for fun only.Whether we enjoy movies like this depends on aesthetics and other things which we feel but don't understand.  Just relax with it.  If you don't like the film, you can probably forget it soon enough.  If you find it entertaining or there's something in it that makes you more comfortable with yourself, go with it.  Just be sure to include a disclaimer if you recommend it to friends.ï»¿"
And Blackie played in this? You kidding me?ï»¿
Starring Bruce Jenner. We'll...there ya go....mystery solved.ï»¿
Lol. Well done.ï»¿
Get educated imbecile. Why are you here again? Same-sex fantasy because you can't be openly gay and be THAT stupid.ï»¿
"Darling, someone help me push...Â Â Â  if the closet in here gets any fuller they'll never keep that door shut!Â ï»¿"
I simply never heard of this at the time.Â ï»¿
Caylin Jennerï»¿
"@jenna Fiorellaalways will be Bruceï»¿"
"Valerie Perrine and the Village People party to a disco beat. Disco records were great with their bass runs and positive attitudes! The Village People perform the classic ""YMCA."" This is Village as in Greenwich Village, New York. They are a motley group: construction worker, GI, cop, leatherman, cowboy and Indian. The soundtrack pulsates with ""I Love You To Death."" Perrine was an ex-Las Vegas showgirl flaunting it in the post-Vietnam/Watergate era.ï»¿"
Was it really so bad??ï»¿
"@Gary Clement YES!!!And I actually paid to see it!!!With my parents and kid brother in tow!!!ï»¿"
"@Gary Clement It fitted the flow of 1980,but has become dated over timeï»¿"
"When I went to see it in Atlanta, the day it came out, there was standing room only.ï»¿"
"@james nyland ""The day it came out""--no pun intended?ï»¿"
I heard Adolf Putin plays this soundtrack for all his Ukrainian detainees.ï»¿
I was in love with the cowboy back then. I was a deluded child.ï»¿
Those little kids had no idea how much cocaine fueled this. Or maybe they did.ï»¿
thumbs up if you're here because of the Cinema Snob!!ï»¿
Lol he brought us all hereï»¿
Never heard of Cinema Snob. Thanks!ï»¿
@Kakure Possenti Thumbs up if you lived through the '70's and this crap entered your life at age 13 years old!!!ï»¿
this is the best trailer in the history of the universe. hilarious!ï»¿
1:13Â  Holy shit poor kidsï»¿
IKR? Why are there children in this to begin with?Â ï»¿
"@belaglikThey're part of a commercial, where they start out as kids then turn into the Village People after drinking milk.ï»¿"
"@belaglik The scene with the kids was no big deal.  Their roles were completely innocent.  Where child actors are concerned, I'm a lot more worried about what motivates parents to put their kids to work in entertainment.  Some former child actors insist they grew up in stable homes, and others have terrifying things to say about narcissistic, greedy parents.  A few have terrifying things to say about adults they met at work.I was never in acting, but I worked occasionally as a child model for print advertising.  It was small-scale.  I just wore dresses promoted by an independently owned store (which may or may not have had a legally binding agreement with the clothing manufacturers), and the ads appeared in one weekly paper.  The owner of the store was good to me, but other people weren't.  No one who saw those newspaper ads heard the verbal abuse I was getting during photo shoots.  Presumably, they didn't know I was denied a salary, either (I was given a few dresses, and in spite of everything I still believe the owner of the store acted with the right intentions, even if others didn't).  The whole thing was thoroughly illegal, unethical and sickening, but since the ads weren't offensive most people had no reason to suspect anything. I recall reading something sad about what Danny Bonaduce experienced while working on the Partridge Family series.  He had problems at home, so whenever possible Shirley Jones or Dave Madden would invite him to stay with one of them.  Danny Bonaduce hasn't turned out too well, but at least there were two adults who tried to create a safety net.  Some kids don't have that much.It should be noted that June Havoc portrayed a stage mother in Can't Stop The Music, albeit the stage mother of an adult son.  She and her sister, Louise, a.k.a. Gypsy Rose Lee, had their lives damaged by a stage mother.  Miss Havoc played the role beautifully, and with humor.  I hope she was at peace with her past.ï»¿"
