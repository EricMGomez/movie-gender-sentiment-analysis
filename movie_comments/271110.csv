"I cried watching the trailer. I'm probably gonna cry like I did watching Steve almost die in the last movie. But that makes it a good movie, when people cry. It means they love the characters. And I love the characters. Mostly Steve. But you get the point XDï»¿"
"This Trailer was better than the Movie. In fact, this Trailer is the Best thing produced by the MCU period. Second is Winter Soldierï»¿"

"Captain America may have known Stark's parents ""accident"" wasn't really an accident, but I'm completely sure he didn't know it was Bucky who killed them, so when he says ""I didn't know it was him"" in the scene with Zero, Bucky and Tony in Civil War, he isn't lying. By not telling Tony what he and Natasha discovered in Winter Soldier about his parents (that they were murdered by hydra), he really isn't getting any benefits for himself, instead, he is preventing Tony from remembering that painful moment in his life.ï»¿"

"Just got back from seeing the film. Ultimately, I rank it 4.5 stars out of 5. I'll admit that there are some really brutal parts in it that make the film hard to see, knowing that the heroes are fighting each other; but in the end, it proves to be currently the most mature installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe to date. Combine a very politically astute plot and clever character development with the all-traditional groundbreaking sound and visual effects and graphics and a musically enthralling score by Henry Jackman, spectacularly executed action and battling sequences, and the addition of brand-new heroes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe straight from the comics to the silver screen, (most notably the ass-kicking Black Panther), and you can start to visualize the true potential of Captain America: Civil War, the final installment of the Captain America trilogy and the thirteenth installment of the M.C.U.(And, speaking as a nineteen-year-old freshman in college, I just find it somewhat amusing to know that the studio cast a nineteen-year-old, Tom Holland, as the new Spider-Man; he was REALLY good in the role, but speaking on behalf of my being more of an Amazing Spider-Fan, I don't really think that he'll ever reach the amazing heights of Andrew Garfield's version -- but he is, however, like Garfield,  SIGNIFICANTLY better than Tobey Maguire -- ultimately ranking Holland as the runner-up, with Garfield as the legend, and Maguire as the rookie).So, there's my perspective. Whether you agree with me or not is entirely up to you; and in the end, I'll pay you my respects to that.ï»¿"

The 3rd trailer showed Bucky shooting Rhodes and Tony was devastated then in a hidden clip Bucky had his metal arm torn off it's obvious Tony did that and who could blame him. And Steve was attacking Tony after seeing his best friend lying on the ground without his arm. How can Steve still attack Tony after he knew Bucky shot Rhodes and Bucky wasn't under Hydra's influence? I'm not sure if I should be rooting for either of these guysï»¿

"To be fair, it was cival war before DC also did Batman vs Superman.  While Marvel actually has reasons for their characters to fight, DC really doesn't.  Marvel's heroes are flawed and their villains heroic - of course they will end up disagreeing at some point.  When people like Stark and Steve have such different values, of course they will end up on different sides at one point.  While it pains me to watch them fight, it should be pretty interesting to watch.  They are loosely following the comics, so it's not like they are pulling this out of their ***.ï»¿"

I still dont get how Cap and Bucky can tag tean ironman he's wearing the fricking bloodshed armor which makes him as strong as THOR. For God's sake Iron can literally just fly them in the air and drop both of them down. Unless Cap or Bucky short circuited Tony's armor Its kinda stupid how they are beating the crap out of Ironman.

So captain America and iron man have a falling out?ï»¿
Captain America turned into avengers _Ÿ˜’_Ÿ˜’ï»¿
I must say out of all the Avengers I really like what they did with Captain America. They didn't make him cheesy or cliche and you can actually believe he is an actual person who just woke up and is trying to live in a new world and that he is a real Badass and doing what he believes is right.  Iron Man is very cool but after 4 movies I am sick of the terrible jokes and humor but I did really enjoy the important deeper moments in the movies. Honestly I don't care they are fighting because the way tony talks to Cap  and I didn't really see their friendship develop in the other movies. its as if it was going to happen anyway. perhaps that was Marvels intention here then at the end Tony will realize how important Cap really is to him but he doesn't realize it yet.ï»¿
Yeah this only looks about 100xs more emotionally engaging that Bat vs Supes.ï»¿

"Ok, the government is OK with tony building a robot that almost killed all humans but with captain america his ass is grass.  Also the government has known there is mind control and they have some hydra agents who would tell you ""Yeah we brainwashed him.""ï»¿"
"Of all the events they had to try to adapt, why did they have to choose the most unnecessarily edgy, character-derailing, IQ-dropping one? Boggles the mind, considering how horrible Civil War was as a comic book event. Slut Sue Storm, Idiot Spider-Man, Incompetent Dr Strange, Useless Reed Richards, Weird Jerk Iron Man, Hardcore Captain America.The only worse event publications I can think of at the top of my head are Avengers vs X-Men and Marvel NOW!.ï»¿"

"Anybody who is a true fan of the comic book genre i think wont care too much that it deviates from the comic book's, given that they have an understanding of metaverse's, multiverse's & also omniverse's.... At times even comic books arent true to comic books which is why alternate states are created. The fact it crosses mediums from comic book to movie makes no difference to me.... it's just meta. I like how different writers take stories on different paths. So long as it's a good story. :Dï»¿"
If they make it just an end credit scene for Spider-Man I will be very disappointed but this is how I think they could pull it off. They have a shot of a room with lots of newspapers from different avengers films with Daily Bugle at the top including Avengers and this film and then have a web shoot out grab onto a newspaper and then pull away. This should then lead into a shot of Tom Holland in a spider man outfit with no mask and you watch as he puts it on and jumps out of the window and swings away. Just my opinion but I think this would workï»¿

Cap also has a shield with a seriously strong medal. Iron Man: Has a new suit, witch If I assume correctly, is the Model 38 Bleeding edge Armor (Not as known because it came before the Iron destroyer armor). This suit has a huge impact on the Marvel Comic Universe, Itâ€™s perks include:Mentally Commanded: kept inside Tonys skin until tony needs itNano Machines that can turn into: clothes, other previous Iron man armors, or even different beings completely, by having the Nano-machines change their properties into whatever Tony wants them to bePowered by the high-yield R.T. node mounted in Tonyâ€™s chest: the node can greatly augment Stark's intelligence and provided him with superhuman-level multitasking and learning capabilitiesWeaponry, witch includes: repulsers, uni-beam, pulse bolts, tasers, and an ENERGY BLADESo yeah, sorry cap. I cant say I am or will ever support you. Guys no crap with this armor Tony beat RED HULK FULLY AMPED.

think the civil war series is not going to do the comic justice by any means.ï»¿
+Remy G Comics will always have better story lines.  They're not limited by movie time.ï»¿
+Remy G Shoot these guys up above beat me to my replies.ï»¿
+mounir maged Eh... Ironman 1 did. Considering how old that particular comic is.ï»¿
+Remy G But the Civil War comic storyline was terrible.  This movie could be the worst in the MCU and still be better than the original Civil War.  That's how bad it was.ï»¿
"You know what does comics justice? Comics. Go read those. Honestly what's with you comic fangays spamming the same shit in every comic based movie? If you've actually read the comics, which I'll assume you haven't because these kinds of comments wouldn't be here, then you'd know how unrealistically difficult it'd be to simulate them. There were dozens of characters in the original 2006 Civil War arc, probably around the same number in the 2015 arc, each character with anywhere from years to decades of established backstory and context. Each character whose story itself consists of dozens of other characters only paper can portray. An 8-figure budget is needed to pull off a good origin story, think of how much it would cost just to adapt just one character's important story arcs. Now imagine doing that to like a hundred characters, and then making a movie that does justice to a hundred characters. You idiots might as well get on a bike and complain about how it will never fly like a jet.ï»¿"
Isn't it boring to go strictly by the comics? Like you already know what's going to happen so why not change it up instead of going by the book?ï»¿
+SuperUnunquadium I completely agree. Movies are movies and comics are comics. Just like how people complain about movies based on books.ï»¿
"+mounir maged Because they don't have to. Sure, there are storylines that are better than the movies, but that's because they've released thousands of CB's vs a total of 13 movies.ï»¿"
"+mounir maged The comic or the movie? Sure, the movie was meh..but the comic book was garbage.ï»¿"
which is good because the comic suckedï»¿
It's the same theory with all book. They just don't have enough timeï»¿
+Meg K And you're not paying a drawing of Iron Man $20 millionï»¿
+Remy G how did captain get under the helicopter so fast do you know why i know why because i Think it was Quicksilver maybe thats why captain look so weird when he was underï»¿
@mounir magedÂ  yes ofc but who knowsï»¿
ok that is bad :( do you know who take cap in under helicopter or is it him self?ï»¿
"@Smilebirde9Â that makes no sense...Why would Quicksilver take cap under a helicopter when Quicksilver could just run into the helicopter and try to knockout the pilot. Quicksilver is dead. Besides, Cap is really quick since he can run at a speed between 45-60 mph.ï»¿"
"The civil war comic book was a little overrated. I'd say the film will be better, will give a better dynamic. Just because the comic has more  characters doesn't mean it's better, more doesn't = better.ï»¿"
+Remy G I think you're a wizard Remy.ï»¿
WHERE IS SPIDERMAN?ï»¿
all tony has to do is call in veronica :p....he calls the hulkbuster suit veronica in case you're a marvel virgin xD jkï»¿

Who else doesn't want this to be like the comics. I just hope some bad guy comes in the middle of the movie like Batman vs Superman. And they all come together to fight him. I love all these series and I don't want this movie to be the death of Captain America.ï»¿

+ace touzin Therefore exclaiming the idea of 'civil' :(ï»¿
It is called civil war because the comic this movie is based on I called civil warï»¿
"+mounir maged well when Steve Rogers is killed by Crossbones at the end of the film, remind us how its not based on the comicsï»¿"
"+Domanic Blanco Chris still has to do I think 1 or 2 more movies, they can't kill him off yetï»¿"

"@ShadowSamuelÂ not really they are missing hulk, thor and hawkeyeÂ ï»¿"
"+ace touzin Hawkeye's in it.ï»¿"
@ace touzinÂ Without Hulk they are still Avengers. Lack of one member doesn't disband whole group.ï»¿
@ShadowSamuelÂ true but it still would be a lot diffrentï»¿
@ace touzinÂ In all superhero tv series or movie series most teams have members different than in original source (comics) and still the teams have their names.ï»¿
"@Bootifuldiamonds from what I've heard, Rogers is revived after Civil War. They bring Evans back for the final Avengers sagaï»¿"
Well marvel don't want to copy dc so that's why civil war isn't called iron man vs cap Americaï»¿

In every nearly every movie you can tell whos good and whos bad by the way the people look and talk... Thats stupid and not realistic at all! This marvel vs dc fan war is stupid in my opinion, kind of like both eventhough marvel is better in my opinion... still kind of funny to see that dc is making a movie about a superhero group (justice league) right after marvel successfully made oneï»¿"

"what I want to know is how, even with Caps strength and buckys bionic arm, they are able to damage the iron suit that was able to withstand a direct hit from a freaking TANK! I mean, anyone who has even a basic understanding of physics and artillery can see that there is no way they could possibly deliver a more powerful strike than a 100 mm round, which it was most likely closer to a 150 mm. Not to mention the possibility of it being an exploding round, which most are. I just don't see it. That is a massive amount of energy, all focused into a relatively small surface contact area.

Please Marvel! Stop making movies! Forever! Every goddamn movie you make is worst than the last one! I dont care if the actors you hire are good! The movies and i mean almost ALL of them are garbage.

Wait so is iron man a bad guyï»¿
+raphy delgado in civil war there are no bad guys or good guys  iron man is both good guy and bad guy   like captain is both good guy and bad guy    read the comic book civil war and you will understand the plotï»¿
+jana D The comics have nothing to do with MCU. There is no secret identities and SHRA. Cap just wants to protect winter solider from prosecution.ï»¿
wellÂ  i dont think iron man or team iron man is a bad guyÂ  hes probably told that it was bucky who assasinated his father and now hes all pissed off cause in winter soldier it shows who bucky assasinates in the past but civil war has more to do with the destruction in age of ultron being that is why the government want to put them on tight leashesÂ ï»¿
@jana DÂ There is another major accident in this movie too. The UN building explosion and virus research centre under attack too. And WS did kill Stark's parents. He made look like a car accident. The problem is that Bucky despite being under Hydra's control is still dangerous killer. He shoots Tony in the face what else Stark can do other then to try to stop him? Â  Â Â ï»¿
im not sure until i see the movieÂ  but mabey winter soldier is after zemo being a high hydra agent and zemo blows up the un building and cause bucky was trying to stop zemoÂ  he was spotted near the un building so they think hes responible for it not sure untill the movie comes out..... id like to know your thoughts about it and if you consider iron man a bad guy in thisï»¿
"@jana DÂ I don't like cap (but I don't think either of them is bad. This is a question of priorities.Cap's priority to find Barnes and keep him alive (he already failed to save him once). I don't think he wants to repeat the experience.And Stark's priority to keep the world safe (as a whole) so Pepper, Happy could live. That's always been the point for him in (both movies and comics). He knows that avengers are necessary since there is no alternative means of protection from global threats.He knows that Aliens will come sooner or later. And the mankind still have to learn properly fly into space. The level of technology on earth is too low in comparison. Â But to keep the Avengers in the ""business"" they can't just ignore the rest of the planet. They will be outlawed pretty quickly. All their gear could be confiscated (cap's shield, IM armours) Wanda could be arrested for working for hydra and so on. If they disagreed to go quietly than they would have to fight against good ordinary people that are not evil villains. And Barnes is a wanted dangerous man that reallyhas killed a lot of people and still might be under control. They cant just say ""U know, world, we're avengers and we don""t care what he did, but he is a friend of Cap so You can't touch him"". This is not a problem that can be resolved by fight unless one of the sides is completely destroyed. And since Stark is on the side of the world he will win since Cap is not prepared to fight against the whole world. Even if he kills IM others will come after him and Bucky. The only way to resolve it is to prove to the world that Bucky was brainwashed and forced to kill. But running away will only prove that he is guilty. Â  Â Â ï»¿"
"@Michelle GhafooriÂ whatever he is fighting against does't matter really. If the opposed side is the WORLD he will have either to kill everyone or he will have to give up.Â I don't think Steve wants to kill ordinary people (policeman, soldiers) that will come after him with orders to arrest him.Â That's exactly why he gave up in the comics. He couldn't fight against people who were Â not evil Hydraï»¿"

"+playbox8g Civil War was part of the comics for a long time. There's no copying or anything. They're just similar. The reasons for fighting are also different.

(That could put all the avengers and their families at great risk). Cap goes against the government and so do a few other avengers, they are labelled terrorists and the government send Iron man to hunt them down.ï»¿"
+Hello There thanks mateï»¿
+Hello There thanks mateï»¿
"+Saul Elgozi But that's not going to be according to comics, since they dont have secret identities. Cap is protecting his friend that is a brainwashed killer that was killing people for Hydra for 70 years and killed Stark's parents. And government wants to arrest him.ï»¿"
He's fighting Iron Man because of the Superhuman Registration Act. The SRA means that all superheroes in America must be controlled by the government. Cap disagreed and now Iron Man and his team of heroes are trying to arrest him.ï»¿
"@Christian ScottÂ There is no superhuman registration act in this film. No secret identities and half of the Avengers don't have superpowers (Clint, Nat, Tony, Sam etc. are only normal humans and even Cap is just a guy in a pick physical form. nothing to register. There is no Thor's clone, no negative zone, no villains that comics had, no Namor, Spider man will not play the same role either.Â This movie has The sokovia accords issued by the United Nations and regulate ONLY the avengers team. So they wouldn't mess up on the territories of other counties, or go protect dangerous killers, they've been acting on their whim and messing up. Wanda brainwashed Hulk to attack a city, in UK Thor fought the Alien elves, sokovia was damaged and there is another accident in this movie in Wakanda. Â This movie is about Cap protecting Bucky from arrest since he is an internationally wanted criminal who killed for 70 years for HYDRA (killed Tony's parents too). There is nothing but the main idea of CAP vs IM taken from the comics, the rest is different. Â ï»¿"

Well the 'Heros' in the trailer are depicted like DC heroes.ï»¿
It's hard to say since the civil war arc is pretty old like I think in the 2000s and the xmen were always viewed as enemies to the people and the xmen have been in marvel since ever lolï»¿

Dude they've done that foreverï»¿
You think there copying them? They get there movies from the comicsï»¿
"You know MARVEL announced all these movies before DC decided to do the same thing right? Also, Civil War isn't about turning the ""heroes into bad guys"" it's about difference of opinion and how even heroes have flaws, which a lot of people seem to forget because DC's heroes aren't really given any human flaws, allowing their fans to connect to the characters better. Captain America and Iron man are disagreeing with each other in the situation given. Batman vs Superman however, is Batman getting jealous and unnecessarily suspicious of Superman and then proceeding to randomly try and kill him. There's no excuse as to why Batman and Superman are fighting, and I seriously doubt there's going to be a good reason Bruce has Kryptonite. Man of Steel didn't continue on from the original movies, and as far as I'm aware, Kryptonite was not a thing that happened in that movie so there's no possible way Batman knows it's Superman's weakness. No possible way that anyone but Superman that it's his weakness. And in an actual fight, Superman would have no chance of loosing if it weren't for the fact he doesn't want to kill Bruce because morals.ï»¿"
"+NOD Gaming Civilians hating heroes in the Marvel universe has pretty much always been a thing. Heck in one Dc/Marvel crossover comic The Marvel Heroes were shocked when the DC civilians cheered for them.It's definitely not a DC thing.ï»¿"

Just because of conflicting opinions these heroes form teams and fighting each other. WTF? are you stupid? Are they really superheroes?

"+LotusEater Watch the movie. They will have a good reason for them fighting.ï»¿"
"@Valpas Kankaristonot more valid than BvS, no matter what explanation they give it becomes stupid because 2 superheroes who had previously worked together is now fighting against each otehr without anyone becoming corrupt.That simply means ONE of them wrong and being friends they forgot that and fight each other. Thats NOT THE QUALITY OF A SUPERHERO. Especially Captain America, he is not supposed to fight them given his character, so to me CA completely loses his character..ï»¿"
"+LotusEater Clearly you either aren't familiar with Marvel's brand of Superhero or missing crucial aspects of many plot threads of the MCU.Marvel hero's are actually flawed, human and make mistakes, so it makes sense that two Superhero's would come into conflict without anyone being the real hero or villain...seeing as Cap is the least complicated hero, it makes sense a old friend like Bucky driving a wedge between him and the government or other Avengers.Plus with Ultron and so many other incidents in the MCU, it makes sense people might start questioning Superhero's and their accountability.ï»¿"
"@TheDalinkwentmakes sense...ï»¿"
"Batman basically got jealous and suspicious of Superman for no real reason. ""Oh hey the last of that guys people just tried to terraform the earth. he must be the bad guy cause he totally couldn't have just let his people do it. let's go kill him."" Literally, when Superman dies or is killed, it's genocide. (I'm not sure if superwoman is in this universe, but same difference) and then none of that fighting even matters because we all know they'll team up to take down some random bad guy. oh wait! and SUDDENLY WONDER WOMAN. Civil war actually has good reason. In the comics, the government wanted to register all powered peopke, Tony agreed with the plan, Cap didn't. Valid reason to fight. And anyone who's read the comics knows Cap dies and Bucky takes up the shield. You can lip read Bucky at 1:59 and it appears he's saying ""Steve's dead"".ï»¿"
"+LotusEater Well, BvS sucked, so HA HAï»¿"
@Manish Bhatia Dawn of Justice was awesome. The marketing sucked.ï»¿
"@Valpas KankaristoÂ To be honest, I was really disappointed with the movie :/ They dragged it out too much and it was just a little ""eh"" at times for me :Pï»¿"

"@LotusEater Yes, because Batman. At least Avengers actually set up their heroes rather than 20 minutes of useless and annoying exposition.ï»¿"
"@Blue DewSET UP? yeah cause they made a lot of movies before that.. DCEU did not want to make more superman and batman movies cause we already have it... So it was obvious we didnt need any setup for superman and batman.. thats why WW aquaman and flash are getting more spotlight next...so this was abt 2 heroes who already have set ups,,, BUT this is DCEU 2nd movie so despite batmans set ups in non DCEU nolan universe they still felt like showing some history to make it their own. whats wrong with that?These complains i hear is basically from people who just cannot sit through drama and 2+ hour of movies..impatient audience thats it.ï»¿"
"Dawn of Justice was awesome, but umm, Avengers was better. ï»¿"
"@LotusEaterÂ I can actually sit through 2+ hour movies, as long as its not pointless dragging out of scenes (which is what happened in DOJ)All I'm saying, is that all they needed to do was show that they knew >insert JL member here< existed, but they didn't have to drag it out and make it annoying.ï»¿"
"@LotusEaterÂ ...What I'm trying to say is, they didn't need to add in so much to foreshadowing it- because it really dragged the movie out, same as with the scenes at the end.And no, I don't fail to understand that the DCU hasn't made movies for anyone but Superman, I am actually a nerd, ya know. I'm actually glad that DC'll be making something other than Batman, Batman, Batman and Superman for once. (Considering Green Lantern wasn't the best, in my opinion.) And I still remember hearing something ages about that DC wasn't gonna make a WW movie because ""it was too complicated"" aaannd then MCU had a talking tree and a raccoon with a machine gun, haha. But I'm glad they will be making one.I understand the need for suspense, but at the end of the movie I was constantly waiting for it to finally finish, but no, it kept on going! (While also getting really frustrated at bloody Lois for being an idiot at the you-know-what-happens-at-the-end-of-the-movie-thing... and I can't say what without spoilers so.)And the same thing with the nightmare scenes- they seemed really unnecessary and were kind of annoying because they weren't really explained as to why they were happening in the first place. Going from a perfectly normal event, suddenly to a nightmare thing, then everything's back to normal and you're left sitting there like ""And the point of that was....?"" I was mostly thinking that he really needed mental help at that point.I also never said it got me bored, and just because I'm pointing out my opinion on the matter, and explaining myself rather than just going ""This movie sucked shit! Blah blah blah hate hate hate etc."" with no explanation. And now that you know my opinion on a single movie, suddenly you know my movie taste? Yeah, right.Â ï»¿"
"@Blue Dewok so your complaint about the movie was that it was too long, so just tell me as to why a long movie should be considered a bad movie? The only reason you gave for this question is about a few scenes that you thought weren't required, still doesnt make it a bad movie... anyways its just your opinion and i m not convinced why someone would call it a bad movie just because they didnt enjoy it.. i mean i get it that you didnt enjoy it and its obvious that you wont give it a 5 star, rather you ll get pulled the other way and give it lesser than it deserved....Nigthmare scene, i agree that was kinda out of the blue... it was a setup for the future movies which i think could have also been avoided or they couldve made it an end credit scene..Having known why they were doing all this i still dont see the reason for a 35% rotten tomatoes, critics just sounds like a bunch of butthurt kids gave their childish personal opinion because the movie didnt meet their expectation.ï»¿"
"@LotusEaterÂ Wow, talking about immaturity, eh? So if I don't like ur movie, I'm suddenly a dumb marvel who likes shitty movies?Â Have you even considered the possibility that some people didn't like BvS not because they're marvel fans, just because they thought it sucked. There is no correlation.ï»¿"
"@Manish Bhatiayeah someone comes to a marvel movie trailer and then says ""well bvs sucked haha"" and then wonders why someone else is claiming you to be a marvel fanboy.... well i dont think any neutral guys will come to a marvel trailer and talk shit abt a dc movie..ï»¿"
"@LotusEaterÂ This guy didn't have to post about a DC movie on a marvel movie trailer.Â And what's wrong with expressing my view?If he hates marvel so much, what is he even doing on this video?ï»¿"
"@Manish Bhatiayeah im not running away like you.. im accepting it unlike you..ï»¿"
"@LotusEaterÂ What am I running away from?Besides, the point he raised in his comment Â was a sub plot of the Avengers (first one).(aliens with super powers come on earth and the avengers had a moral conflict. Fury wanted to build an arsenal, Cap was against it, Stark was annoyed because he didn't have a say in it, Banner was appalled at the idea of avengers as a team)Â Marvel does it, no one notices it, it is just a ""popcorn flick"".DC does it, fanboys start screaming ""it's too philosophical for marvel fanboys!""Philosophical, my assï»¿"
"@Manish Bhatiayeah when philosophies dont match smart humans especially the one with responsibility like spiderman puts it arent supposed to fight each other, especially when they know each otehr isnt a threat to humanity.LMFAO, so they end up fighting and cause more destruction to humanity? Yeah yeah atleast batman once figuring out superman isnt a threat stops the fight..this ia team which has worked together and yet they want a piece of each otehr meant jsut because they dont think alike like you and me .. yeah they make great superheroes and a good movie plot..my ass XDï»¿"
"@LotusEaterÂ Dude, did you even get my comment?? I was talking about the avengers, not civil war. They don't fight each other in the avengers (except hulk vs Thor, but that was just hulk out of control).Â How can you judge civil war before it even comes out??Â I was saying when marvel made a movie on the topic of aliens comin, causing differences in heroes' opinion, it's dismissed as a ""popcorn flick"". But when DC does the same topic, fanboys shit themselves saying ""it's too complex for dumb people to understand!"", hence justifying their terrible movie.Â Also, the actual fight between them was stupid. Using smoke grenades against superman, and they work??? Dafuq??ï»¿"
@LotusEaterÂ I feel like you are replying to me by mistakeï»¿
"@Manish Bhatiaim replying to you to what you said .. go back and see if i was ever talking about aliens in avengers being wrong.. if not then probably you were replying to the wrong topic...ï»¿"
"@LotusEaterÂ No, I never said you said it was wrong. I was just saying the avengers also showed a similar topic, but nobody realised it. And now BvS has done it, everybody's going crazy over itï»¿"
"@Manish Bhatiayeah but did avengers raise any questions regarding the philosophy of trusting aliens? as far as i remember it didnt..Â  well only thor is kinda alien and it was addressed in the thor movie not avengers movie.ï»¿"
"@LotusEaterÂ To each, his own. But don't go shitting on trailers of movies you don't likeï»¿"
"@LotusEaterÂ It's not just that it was dragged out. The thing I really don't like about the movie is the way they did Superman/Clark Kent. Clark is supposed to be clumsy, awkward and kinda shy at times, but the way they've done him here is literally Superman with glasses. There's no personality difference, which was the point of his alter ego.The only thing (I think) they did right was when Superman was basically just like ""Hey, Bats, I need you to help me so I don't have to kill you!"" while Batman refuses to listen and continues to beat him up. 'Cause that's the sort of thing Supes would do in that situation.And with the things you were talking about with Manish, I think what your not fully grasping is the difference between MARVEL and DC heroes. MARVEL heroes are flawed, more human (more relateable through this) and they make mistakes because they're still normal people underneath their powers/gadgets (hence fighting over a difference in opinion, like in Civil War. It's something that we humans do everyday). DC heroes are very God-like. They're over powered, mostly ""indestructible/undefeatable"", very few weaknesses. So its really silly trying to compare the way they operate together.And again, there's no use judging a movie by its trailer. Some trailers really suck but the movie is awesome.Â ï»¿"
"@Blue Dewno matter how human you are, when you are responsible you arent supposed to fight with each other.. now i know im going against the cannon which might be stupid of me, but i wrote this comment with regard to those idiots who said the same about BvS, So i just wanted to prove that the logic here is better with DC than with Marvel.Infact im not a DC vs marvel guy.. i grew up with Bats Supes Spidey and He-man.. to me there was no difference between bats and spidey, both were superheroes to me.. infact the rest of marvel was non existent for me.. none of them were famous outside america...Anyways, i just get pissed off at marvel fans and i end up writing like im a dc fan.. you might say dc fans are annoying too but hey dc didnt get a head start of 8 years in movies, they just began.. Anyways im wasting too much time on youtube.. im muting this post...good day.ï»¿"
"@LotusEaterÂ Yeah, MARVEL did get a head start on the movies, 'cause they've spent a lot of time planning it out, but DC is rushing its universe too much by trying to cram as much in as they can to catch up with MARVEL's end date for their MCU with Infinity War. They aren't taking enough time to fully develop their stories and cameos and such which for me personally is what's letting their universe down- as well as the fact that WB studios is taking away a lot of control that the directors and writers have and such have over the movie, how it looks and what happens.Just a lot of the stuff in BvS was forced and glossed over- and Superman did basically nothing the entire movie. Scenes- like where WW checks her emails and we get the 20 minutes of JL exposition was badly placed. It would have been better after the fight or as an end credit scene, because it just really didn't make sense to be there.""No matter how human you are, when you are responsible you aren't supposed to fight with each other."" Have you even met the human race, mate? Civil War is about the consequences of difference in opinion and pressure by the government etc. The government wanted to register everyone with powers and use them to their advantage or whatever. There are the people in the group who agree with Steve on matters, and then others with Tony. And some people get violent while trying to push their opinion, responsible or not, its what humans do. Doesn't matter if they're heroes or not, they're still human.Anyway, I know I won't get a reply if you've muted this post, so, yeah.Â ï»¿"
I like FOOD!ï»¿
"@Tyler HerdÂ That may be the case, but it does cause too much to be placed in a single movie and it drags out the movie and thins how powerful the threat is. Things will be brought up, quickly brushed aside or forgotten. With big superhero groups like Justice League and Avengers though, it can be very beneficial (If done correctly and well enough) to have stand alone movies for each character so that they dont have to try and cram everything into a big chunk of expositional backstory etc. So, DC may be slightly rushing their universe in this sense.ï»¿"
"+LotusEater this whole issue is a perfect representation of the flaw of iron man and the stubbornness of captain america. Iron Man was in the right up to the point where he says that any form control takes he's game. Because his plans, while in the right when it comes to intentions, are too oppressive, and controlling.

He is also refusing to accept that he needs to answer to the people of the united states when it comes to his actions. He wants no over sight, no responsibility: he could care less who he hurts or what damage he creates as long as he gets his goals, and obviously cares nothing for the justice system or due process, and clearly has no problem turning on his own team mates and betraying his country over a criminal who was once his friend, all while self righteously holding his nose in the air as if he is better than everyone else.Â I hope Captain dies, he is a worthless and despicable characterï»¿"
"+Michael Romigh You basically just described Tony Stark for all three Iron Man movies. Bucky can't be held completely responsible for all of the murders considering he was brainwashed. Should he answer for the crimes he committed....yes. Should he be put to death....I don't think so since he wasn't in his right mind, and Cap knows this.ï»¿"
"+Ebb Yates I agree that he wasn't responsible, but that's why we have a justice system that uses due process. It's not his place to supersede that just because he likes the guy. Not to even mention, his character is just plain BORING!ï»¿"
"I agree with you on the justice system too, however, in the preview Cap clearly states that those guys are not planning on bringing Bucky in alive.Â ï»¿"
"+Ebb Yates Yes, he says that, but we don't know if that's actually true, or if cap just thinks that's the case. Maybe the movie will clarify that.ï»¿"
+Ebb Yates Cap says it about policemen that are storming the house with known terrorist with superpowers inside the house that is possibly armed. They're normal people and it would be really hard for normal people to arrest supersolider like Bucky without trying to kill him.

If superheroes were controlled by the government, I think that'd be a bit of a problem for Cap.

But what about Hawkeye when he was brainwashed or that Doctor guy (I forgot) who helped research to open up that portal for the Chitauri to come in,  but if Bucky is brainwashed and does all this stuff, it's a no no?

KNOWING he would be outlawed and have police (normal good people and not HYDRA) after them.What is his goal?

"@Michelle GhafooriÂ ""he is FINALLY free' no he is not, obviously.Â ""they do to try and repay for there mistakes?""they are working with law. Stark has saved the world multiple times, brings greenÂ energyÂ projects, has a MARIA STARKÂ Foundation working for humanitarian causes. Doc from the A1, that opened portal, helped in Thor2. They do stuff to make a world safer. But TeamCap is just running away, and fights when they don't agree. Hero is not a title, it's the actions that define a hero. Since when running around and blowing stuff, with intent not to be arrested is heroic lol ? Â ï»¿"
"Okay, so the people who were brainwashed are indeed trying to help the world to repay for there mistakes. But meanwhile Bucky just got out of his brainwash and still trying to recover, he no longer does that anymore. With cap, he'd probably be able to do ""good things"" but you know, no time is being given for him to ""change his ways"". Also they're not going to arrest Bucky / take him alive, they're going to kill him, not even gonna be heard out or anything, or even go through a justice process or go to jail, just, dead. And that's wrong, That's (partially) the reason why he's fighting against them, is how I interpret it.((Edit: And before you say ""well Hawkeye was brainwashed and recovered easily in a short amount of time11!!"" Bucky was being manipulated for 7 decades.)ï»¿"
"@GentSÂ What are you talking about? THEY DO JUST ARREST HIM. That was shown even in the trailer, Cap just thought they wanted to kill Bucky.The police goes after a killer here, by the way. So It's stupid to expect them to go unarmed. Especially considering that Bucky is enhanced dude with metal arm. Â Not only that! Clint was ARRESTED by the Black Widow. She allowed him back ONLY bc it was clear that the magic of the sceptre was gone.AND BUCKY IS STILL CONTROLLED and a dangerï»¿"
"How is bucky still controlled? He's not brainwashed Â anymore. Also clearly they come over to the building in the trailer with weapons, they are not unarmedï»¿"
"@GentSÂ He is Still braiwashed IN this movie. That's the point.Â Of course police IS armed. They're always armed. And they're trying to arrest or take down a man that was a killer for 70+ years.ï»¿"
@Michelle GhafooriÂ You mean brainwashed victim that could snap and kill more people? Would real Bucky want that?Â ï»¿
@Michelle GhafooriÂ Well Zemo is not that evil himself in this movie... He is misguided and wants ravage just like Wanda wanted in the AoU... And crossbones will be taken care ofï»¿
@Michelle GhafooriÂ You know it's already on in EuropeÂ ï»¿
@Michelle GhafooriÂ It's so frustrating. Why not release everywhere in the same time? Makes no sense... Â ï»¿
for how many years isï»¿
Now this seems like a pretty sick trailer...ï»¿
"people are forgetting that it wasn't even cap that started the war,  it's Tony Stark... in the comics he's the one who was secretly finding both sides and came out Victor when all the superheroes that took sides stopped fighting from seeing Goliath killed... but oh well,  no one care about the comics anymore, especially Hollywood directors smhï»¿"

"Marvel makes better trailer. DC makes better movie, comics and video games. Fair enough.ï»¿"
+low sheng Personal preferences tbh. DC&#39;s is overall more serious and dark. In contrast with Marvel which is lighter and easier to watch.ï»¿
"+low sheng DC makes awful movie, grimdark comics, and Batman video games only.Marvel makes amazing trailers, amazing movies, good comics, and Spider-Man video games are okay.ï»¿"
