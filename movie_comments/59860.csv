when i saw cory i couldn't stop crying.ï»¿
"selena impersonating herself. identity issuesï»¿"

UMMM Lizzie McGuire movie anyone? Wow. How original...ï»¿
I was thinking the same thing! Glad I wasn't the only one that noticedï»¿
Okay but donna noble and blair waldorf thoughï»¿
"omg cory and selenai am going to watch this movieï»¿"
TB to this iconic movie where Selena showed us her acting skills playing two diferent people and snatching us in the process.ï»¿
rip coryï»¿
This iconic filmï»¿
"Would someone tell me why a movie with Selena Gomez has 11 million views and why she's the most followed person on Instagram?She's more overrated than Jennifer LawrenceI get it that she's likeable and she seems like a nice person but she has no talentShe uses auto tune and her acting is just indescribableLet's just say her best work is wizards of Waverley place And the fact that her albums go to number 1 when she can't sing to save her own lifeThat proves more than anything that Hollywood is only about appearance Your pretty skinny and make money you have itIt doesn't matter if your talent less And don't get me started on how she uses people like Taylor and bieber to get attentionI mean who even knew her except kids who watch her Disney show if she never dated Justin and became bffs with Taylor?I dislike her even more for dumping Demi her childhood bff because Taylor is more famous and she wanted to get all the attention unlike Demi who's not as famous and popular as swiftï»¿"
that is not true and you know it_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
"It is but when you love someone your blinded and you don't see their flaws We can all agree at least that they are more talented people who deserve more recognition than Selenaï»¿"
why? why..why there is no full movie of this??ï»¿
What happened to these kinda movies _Ÿ˜©_Ÿ˜«_Ÿ˜__Ÿ’”ï»¿
"Wait....WHO SAYS IS IN THIS MOVIE?I literally only knew it from Selena's vevo. Omgomh kmï»¿"
"as a glee fan when i saw Cory i couldn't  breathe, then i cried. I love being emotionally attached to showsï»¿"
Xoxo gossip girlï»¿

"Have you ever thought of your life as a movie? I think itÂ´s fun.ItÂ´s a lot like it really can be, if you just change your perspective. You can be like a dark movie theater, where the light from the screen (life) gets to, when you donÂ´t fill your head with thoughts instead. This is what ""seeing the light"" means too.Â *Thinking blocks life.* It isnÂ´t healthy to do when you need not to. Google the truthcontest.ï»¿"
