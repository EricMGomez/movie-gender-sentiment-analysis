that's not even a real lady it's just a stupid dollï»¿
Madness made manifestï»¿
i love this movie itâ€™s so sweetï»¿
"This is the driver of ""Drive"" after he lost Irene.ï»¿"
"The most ludicrous part of this movie was that, if Lars had be made to tend to the dammed thing himself, he would have tired of it much sooner. Talk about enabling on the part of the sister and brother! They even bath it without Lars' presence? Those two are equally sick, IMOï»¿"
"There's no way i'm gonna watch this movie, but for some reason I feel glad it existsï»¿"
why is this trailer like if the movie was some sort of family comedy? wtfï»¿
I somehow feel uncomfortable with having the same name with the doll. But at least Ryan Gosling said my name hahahahaï»¿
"His Girlfriend ""Joi"" in Bladerunner was better. At least she could talk and smile!ï»¿"
Lars and the Real Kirkï»¿
and the oscars goes to... Bianca!ï»¿
So...where can I get a Bianca?ï»¿
"Who else is here because they  Googled Ryan Gosling sex doll?  Not what I had in mind, but not bad either.ï»¿"
The three main actors are amazing in this movie....I loved it so much..!! It is for sure an underrated movie...ï»¿
"Wait, you want me to believe that there's a scenario in which Ryan Gosling doesn't have ANY girls hitting on him, and is single because he's unattractive/weird? Yeah, I don't think I can muster THAT much suspension of disbelief.ï»¿"
Bladerunner 2049ï»¿
My Aunt is Nancy Oliver! She is the writer! I am so proud!ï»¿
Jesus tap dancing Christï»¿
one of my absolute faves of his!ï»¿
"can't wait to see the prequel, Ryan Gosling and his waifuï»¿"
I'd love to be an actress like Bianca.ï»¿
When i watched it the first time i didn't knew who was Ryan Gosling. I think it had something to the caracter that he is a sex symbol without playing on that tones here.ï»¿
"Having watched Blade Runner 2049 recently I find this doubly hilarious...Also were people actually familiar with Ryan Gosling before Drive came out?ï»¿"
"Yeah, he was in The Notebook. That was in 2004.ï»¿"
Well it took 10 years but they finally made a sequel to this movie.Its called Blade Runner 2049.ï»¿
Why did you title the Blade Runner 2049 trailer incorrectly?ï»¿
_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
<3ï»¿
Bianca heh? Does she... ?ï»¿
1:32 - 1:35 I'm dying this is so funnyï»¿
Worst cringey autistic movie everï»¿
Stupid ass white people..ï»¿
I've seen the porno version. Way better. Only one actor.ï»¿
Bladerunner brought me here. Joi reminded me of it.ï»¿
"This movie still makes me cry. I see myself so much in this character, it makes me wanna yell at him. Great movie tho.ï»¿"
This film would make more sense if they got someone who isn't as good looking as Gosling. Good looking people don't tend to be socially awkward. Think they shoulda got Jon Heder or someone like that.ï»¿
Sorry but I believe this is not true. Any person good looking or not can go through socially awkward experiences or even social anxieties. You will never imagine the insecurities people can go through in their minds or the experiences that got them to be there. Sorry for my answer but I want to be a friendly reminder of not stereotyping people based on their looks.ï»¿
hey look its sergeant k with his girlfriend lmaoï»¿
good movie but the trailer spoils too muchï»¿
"I feel like the ""Bianca could help you"" is not something that a person would actually say. While you may reply with ""Noone would even treat a lifesize doll as a person at all"", that would be untrue. There are some people that treat their dolls similar to real people. They don't have delusions that their doll can actually do anything though.ï»¿"
"Love Ryan Gosling, he is so sensitive!ï»¿"
Blade Runner 2049 lookin' greatï»¿
"And in 2049, Ryan Gosling still has a fake girlfriendï»¿"
Bianca was clearly the precursor to Joi.ï»¿
blade runner 2049ï»¿
"Man, the new Blade Runner is looking greatï»¿"
new Blade Runner looks amazing :oï»¿
Blade Runner 2049 looks great!ï»¿
This movie was one of the weirdest movies I've seen and it was kind of unrealistic but the movie was really sweet and funny at timesï»¿
"""Whats right for everybody"" Code for, what benefits women.ï»¿"
WOMEN = CHEAP THRILL that's WAY OVERPRICEDï»¿
this is why feminism is cancerï»¿
the soundtrack they used in this trailer is piss poorï»¿
"The reality is that female sex robots/companions are getting more realistic and less expensive very quickly. Since ""real"" women today are more selfish, greedy, nasty and hard for men to deal with these robots are skyrocketing. Feminists and women will go into overdrive to shame the men that use them and the sales of sex robots/companions will undoubtedly got through the roof. This silly chick flick avoids the reality behind the existence and growing popularity and attempts to convince us of the reality of the ""good"" woman that will love the character that Goslin plays for who he is and attempt to bring him out of his shell. This is a complete lie and fantasy!ï»¿"
it appears as if hollywood is going MGTOW...ï»¿
"funniest movie of all time, omg i died of laughter. currently typing this as a ghost.ï»¿"
I watched this movie and honestly I think this is one of Ryan Gosling's best works.ï»¿
Sorry but this movie looks stupid.ï»¿
When Andy couldn't give up his toys this happenedï»¿
I love Ryan in indie filmsï»¿
inspire trailers binge anyone?ï»¿
sex toys for 4000 dollars :Pï»¿
Tacky trailer. Not tacky movie. Good Movie.ï»¿
Ryan is so cute... I wanna squeeze his bum lolï»¿
so if u dont have gf you are gay ? lol stupid western mindset at its bestï»¿
Ryan Gosling looking like David Arquetteï»¿
I didnt know if I should laugh or cry while i was watching this movie..ï»¿
Bianca reminds me of Shay Saint Johnï»¿
I can't get over the fact that the doll has the same name as me...it's hilarious xDï»¿
I would be DEEPLY concerned if my loved one did anything like this.ï»¿
"Great film, the only bad bit being the ending, where he gets a ""real"" girlfriend and he's therefore cured and welcomed back into the fold of conventionality - until then it's interesting.ï»¿"
the whole town was playing along because they care about him that's really sweet_Ÿ˜_ï»¿
I miss the old Ryan Gosling.ï»¿
Stunningly Magical Movie...I want to live in such a townï»¿
This is actually a very sad movie.ï»¿
Kristen Stewart was great in the lead role!!ï»¿
is this a real film???ï»¿
J o n a t h a n yesï»¿
"Reminds me so much of me, just missing the sex doll, and there you have it.ï»¿"
"My life in a nutshell, although I dont have the money to get a lifelike doll. FML.ï»¿"
You don't have to; to be technical. You can buy one by parts. Head first and body later. Head is cheaper anyways and can still serve its purposes. lolï»¿
this is brilliant in sooo many ways. love this film very much âù_âù_âù_âù_âù_âù_âù_ï»¿
Bianca be nominated for Grammys after this performance _Ÿ’¯ï»¿
Yes less stilted than Kristen Stewart....ï»¿
#GrammysSoPlasticï»¿
You mean oscars.. Grammys is for music lolï»¿
I guess she less overatted than Meryl Streepï»¿
Moroccans be like 1800dh is nothingï»¿
WTF are you mumbling you piece of shit ?ï»¿
"Yeah,mind your own business. I posted this comment 4 months ago. So shut the F upï»¿"
And I'm gonna say it twice Mind Your Damn Mother Fucking business.Ciaoï»¿
"@MKBNo you little bitch i wont because you are using your demagoguery by writing bullshit. Go fuck yourself !!ï»¿"
"Hahaha, You have some serious problems with yourself. Yo HATER go see some Doctorï»¿"
"blah blah blah keep saying shit dumbass. I can say whatever i want, whenever i want. This comment section isn't yours and I won't Stop talking ""bullshit"" as you described it. I dunno what's up with you Bro, I'm serious you need to see some DOCTOR, so he can tell you to mind your fucking business..........ï»¿"
You still here smh oooooh I'm scaredï»¿
"@MKBWhy arent you ? You are replying to every comment so meaning i am in your fucking mind bitch. hahahaï»¿"
"Who the fuck gets scared from a comment, another thing don't forget that you started replying to me first. I'm the one in your fucking mind and this will be my last reply bye bitchï»¿"
"_Ÿ_” I heard Bianca was better to work with and a much better lover then Rachel McAdams from The Notebook lol_Ÿ˜„_Ÿ˜Å...., and she almost took Leonardo DiCaprio's Oscar's from him lol_Ÿ˜Å...,  so watch out people..._Ÿ˜„..., get out of Bianca's way..._Ÿ˜¡_Ÿ™„_Ÿ˜_...ï»¿"
That cuck Onision sent me hereï»¿
"I can't believe I cried numerous times during this movie,. I am not even that sensitive, i don't know what happenedï»¿"
This movie is so powerful and good that it makes a love story between a man and a freakin doll so damn emotionalï»¿
"@zizoegy8460 It wasn't really the relationship between them, it was the fact that Lars was so disconnected from reality that really got to me.ï»¿"
"+Lili SzabÃ_ Yeah same thing, I could feel for him the entire movieï»¿"
"Man,it's a drama,you're supposed to cry.ï»¿"
the ending is sweet than he finally have that guts to walk into reality and ask a girl to be with himï»¿
those real dolls are way too expensive to just throw out at the endï»¿
I bet someone dug it after the credits.ï»¿
Yeah they cost 6k USD.... ANd you would have to clean them out regularly....ï»¿
"Depends on the material. Silicone can cost that amount. If you go with thermo elastic polymer, you can get it as low as $1400 in USD. Still the cost of tax refund though, but cheaper than the 6k you stated.ï»¿"
only if people are as nice as the people in that townï»¿
"They're canadians, that's why.ï»¿"
"@el chingonlooooolï»¿"
Thought that too. This makes this movie about the least realistic I've ever seen. If you start a relationship with an object in the real world NOBODY will treat you this friendlyï»¿
Let's not forget guys it's Canada.ï»¿
That would probably just make it worse.ï»¿
"well, he is ryan gosling. everybody loves himï»¿"
bianca looks almost like Krysten Ritterï»¿
It was Kristen Stewart I thought actually in the lead role no?ï»¿
Ryan looks so weird.. Still hot tho.ï»¿
Kristen Steward did great here.ï»¿
"I just spit my coffee, oh my goooddddd, you're awesome hahahahaï»¿"

You are AMAZING!ï»¿

"This is the best comment on YouTube, hands down _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿"
That is true. That is why she's raking in millions of dollars and you're not_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
AYYY LMAOï»¿
Did Bianca get an Oscar for this?ï»¿
Fire Bianca next time no acting at allï»¿
"Fatman - Daily Fortnite Videos Seriously, so wooden. She needs to go back to acting school.ï»¿"
I feel like I just watched the whole movieï»¿
Welp you did xDï»¿
I came here for the trailer. I also feel like I don't need to see the movie.ï»¿
+thedarkone123123 lol there's not much excitement that part where he showed up w a doll was the best still good movie if you like awkward and future serial killerï»¿
I don't think there is much more to it?ï»¿
shut upï»¿
Domonique Campbell You don't even know what happens at the end tho...ï»¿
no!ï»¿
Such a beautiful film. _Ÿ˜_ï»¿
Absolutely psycho.ï»¿
"1:35 ""I wish I had a woman that couldn't talk.""  lolï»¿"
"I discovered this movie a few years ago. This movie is very good. It shows us how we as humans have all felt at one point or another. Also shows us how much Lars is loved in regards to how everyone jumps on the bandwagon to help him along on this long journey back to the world. We as humans appear to be strong but when we feel pain, happiness, or sadness it goes to our core. Again what his town did for him was a wonderful feat. This lets me see human nature in its greatness. I've never seen love in that form but still it reminds me of our humanity that we are not alone.ï»¿"
YOUR COMMENT IS TO LOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNGGGGGGGï»¿
antonio cansay: Reading hurts does it kitten?ï»¿
Its a movie.ï»¿
Ive never seen anyone care... like a movie nawww lolï»¿
"The best part of the movie for me was when they were walking out of the church and they gave Bianca the bouquet of flowers and Lars says ""those are nice huh? They're not real so they'll last forever. Isn't that neat?""ï»¿"
Closing the Loop yes very cleverï»¿
I don't find Ryan Gosling good looking but there's something about him that's so damn sexy and hot.ï»¿
"indeed, i think his face is pretty away of what one could consider typically beautiful and still he's very handsome in his own wayï»¿"
"+aki bono IKR, I feel the same way_Ÿ˜_ï»¿"
"""don't find Ryan Gosling good looking but there's something about him that's so damn sexy and hot.""...that'd be his moviestar status and moneyï»¿"
He is SENSITIVE ;-)ï»¿
"I love this movie.  The DVD box made it seem like a goofy comedy so I dragged my heels watching it a little bit, but it was really sweet, and still had some great humor.  Not a perfect movie but good enough I've willingly watched it more than once.ï»¿"
RIGHT TN! SUP YO!$ OCEANIC SIDE !ï»¿
"I actually cried when Bianca, well, you know.....ï»¿"
When she died? Oh it was so sad!ï»¿
what the actual fuckï»¿
"""Wish i had a woman that could not talk"" hahaha what a well placed lineï»¿"
I saw this movie a few years ago and now i'm watching the trailer and crying my eyes out. Thanks.ï»¿
i love paul schnieder so muchï»¿
David Torn brought me here.ï»¿
I know it might make a good premise for a film but I'm pretty sure that psychologist just encouraged everyone to be enablers...ï»¿
Bianca still shows more emotion than Kristen Stewart XDï»¿
+Aaron â€œAarondamort Boogledooâ€ù Smith lol. that's true.ï»¿

"Are you basing that off her work in ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" and ""Personal Shopper"" Or her work in ""Twilight""?ï»¿"
"Looks like ""that part of YouTube"" made a movie....ï»¿"

what a great film...loved itï»¿
"Very powerful and beautiful film. So touching, I loved itï»¿"
Who plays Bianca? She's such a great actress. Really made the film what it is.ï»¿ï»¿
"+Maya Magination I don't know, I thought her performance was a little too stiff.ï»¿"
+Maya Magination I think it's Kristen Stewartï»¿
@SpiritOfSamhainÂ Wow. Probably her some if her best work to date. Really struck a chord.ï»¿
"+Maya Magination Not too often do I read a youtube comment, That is actually funny!ï»¿"

"SpiritOfSamhain... HAHA!!! There was (another!) ""Twilight"" marathon playing over the weekend. My sister & nieces had it going on multiple TVs (b/c they like it). At one point my mother came storming into the kitchen & said: ""What is wrong with that girl?  She acts less human than the vampires! How is she making friends? And why are TWO boys fighting over her?"" (This is not uncommon. It's the effect Kristen Stewart & her ""acting"" have on my mom & me--we are constantly  plagued by the same questions, but too hypnotized by the monotone of her voice to seek any real answers...)ï»¿"

I feel like I watched the whole movie in 2 minutes. It gave away the whole plot and so many spoilers.ï»¿
All this time I was waiting for Bianca to move. Seriously all this time I sat here and I waited for her to blink at least.ï»¿
Too many horror movies in your lifetime? I get it..ï»¿
"He went from Rachel McAdams to Bianca, good choice. ï»¿"
"+NunyJr Or better so, Emma Stone to Biancaï»¿"
and now back to Emma Stoneï»¿
Reef and then Ana de Armas.ï»¿
Why haven't I've seen this movie on Tv Like so many others and also this movie is based on men that are like lars who have social interaction problems or women who do not find guys like them attractive bc let's be honest in today society its all about the Looks what most ppl fail to realize is that this is a very real movie about men who are very lonely and have low self-esteem issues and can not get laid or have a relationship with a women bc girls do not find them attractive this movie shows how judgmental women really are and the effect that it has on guys Like lars  when you been an outcast you're whole life and no one what's to be with you bc of how you look having a doll is better then having no one this movie shows the reality of that and how lonely some men really are its sad but true. This movie is a wake call to women and they should realize to stop being so judgmental and judging guys on their looks because there are real nice guys out there but girls are to judgmental to see that bc all women today want The Hot guy and nothing else.ï»¿
@David Boyd yeah but also you are pretty to women like angel if you have very much moneyï»¿
"Yeah because men never judge women based on looks. This is not about gender but society as a whole you will find plenty of straight women in the same situation , and gay men and gay women. It is not a case of all women as a whole gender  screwing over all men as a whole gender. Don't be ignorantï»¿"
"+David Boyd I wouldn't put it all on women. It's up to us to sort out our issues, with whatever help we can find.ï»¿"
Yeh because a guy who looks like Ryan Gosling would ever have troubles with women smhï»¿
"+David Boyd That's not what I got from it.  The whole point of this movie to me was that Lars never found peace about his mother's death.  So he never wanted to open up to other people because he was scared to get hurt.   That's why just touching someone made him feel like he was in intense pain.  He also believed that no one actually loved or cared for him because even his own brother abandoned him.  He felt so alone, and he thought that no one loved him, so he got Bianca.  Bianca could never hurt him, and he imagined that she loved him no matter what.  But after his sister in law yelled at him, he realized that he was indeed loved and that people cared.  The town welcoming Bianca allowed him to finally break out of his comfort zone, and after going bowling with Margo, he realized that Margo's touch didn't hurt him.  He was finally free of the fear that he was unloved.ï»¿"
"I loved this movie when I saw it ages ago. Now I just have to see it again, because I don't remember the ending! I remember that it had both really funny and sad parts, though.ï»¿"
Such a good movie!!!!ï»¿
he is fucking crazyï»¿
He is the only normal person I see in this film.ï»¿
Opinion wich I do not share :)ï»¿
This movie is racist towards guys with mustaches!ï»¿
+robotpanda77 Â¸or you ment descrimination :D or you ment the mustaches are black and not whiteï»¿
Fantastic film! I've been a fan ever since.ï»¿
Such a beautiful filmï»¿
"The funniest part of this movie is ""RYAN GOSLING"" doesn't have a girlfriend.ï»¿"
LOLï»¿
Hahaha =D True that :'Dï»¿
this was the first thing i've ever seen him in so i was quite shocked to find out he's considered a heartthrob in real life. goes to show what a great actor he is!ï»¿

Does he end up marrying Bianca and having babies? Ryan Gosling is A adorable!ï»¿
good movie!ï»¿
"Amazing film, Gosling was amazing, hes connection with Bianca was incredible and is really an indicative of how great he is as an actor. Hope he wins an Oscar soon, hes amazing.ï»¿"
"wow, how the hell did i miss this movie?? :oï»¿"
Very underrated movie.ï»¿
"He was nominated for an oscar for it, so no it wasn't underrated.Â ï»¿"
he was never nominated for an oscar for this.ï»¿
@_“_™_§_êÖ·_¨_“ _§_™_œ_¢Â  Multiple nominations actually.ï»¿
yes but not for an oscar. he still did a great job in this.ï»¿
and probably the only Ryan Gosling movie that I actually liked. Nothing against the dude though.ï»¿
I swear this advert could be a parody.ï»¿
I love this movieï»¿
"I came across this movie from searching for best comedies. It is sodark but my belly hurts so bad from laughing. It's brilliantly wellwritten. I most love how the film is set non materialistically in asmall little blue collar town to portray the best level amount of LOVE.Man oh man, I'd killed to be loved unconditionally like this!!!ï»¿"
"This is no comedy. That moment when Lars throws away the flower - it's the only moment in the movie that feels like a classical all American comedy, it's a solid drama, especially for those who can relate to Lars. A great movie to watch, just don't forget that those laughter tears will make you a bit sad too!Â ï»¿"

She's much better at acting in this movie than in twilight. Maybe it's because the male counterpart is better.ï»¿
best two top commentsï»¿
"This was actually a very sweet movie. Plus, it has Ryan Gosling, which makes it all the better.ï»¿"
"No no ,, Kristen isn't that good at acting ï»¿"
"GREAT film!ï»¿"
Interesting lolï»¿
And I still love him. That means it must be true love ;) ï»¿
I literally started looking around on the internet after reading that. Where is my mind...ï»¿
Ryan Gosling with a porn 'stache in a grandpa sweater? lol WTFï»¿
"Man, this movie was sad.ï»¿"
What's gonna happen if he orders a new doll? lmaoï»¿
No. She has more personality than Kristen Stewart has ever had in her moviesï»¿
Patricia Clarkson is perfect for this roleï»¿
my mom passed away and when i sat down and watched this movie it reminded me everything i felt. All the feelings we hide find away of letting themselves out. The scene where they are bowling and the music kicks in put a smile on my face and made me happy for a bit. Loved it. ï»¿
Ha !ï»¿
This is seriously one of Ryan's greatest movies. There is so much emotion in his scenes. Great movie!!ï»¿
I loved this movie! And it brought tears to my eyes to be honest. It worths a watch!ï»¿
It annoys me tht the people who made this trailer added comedic sound effects and music to make it seem like a 'comedy'. the movie itself has no laugh track elements at all and its funniest bits are as dark as they are humorous. This movie is about a guy getting over his mothers death. totally under rated movie. ï»¿
HAï»¿
there's a reason why shows like my strange addiction exist...ï»¿
lol thats all i have to say.ï»¿
"I think it's kristen stewart, not sure tho.ï»¿"

You saw a woman have multiple orgasms on the first edition male dolls?ï»¿
i would fuck that real doll so hard I would have to give her a wheelchair for christmasï»¿
megan foxï»¿
see you are wrong. i have girls on my fb who own men real dolls. that is a fact anna banana. and i have had 2 four year relationships. several one year ones. i just dont like to do it no more. and just like it is a fetish to like bondage etc. or a pantyhose fetish etc. i and many others have a doll fetish. i know married couples who have them. so dont judge a book by the cover. yes i am sure more men own them than woman. for sure. but i am sucessfull. have a nice home. see my vids. ï»¿
"Um... no offense but...lets be serious the real thing is probably better, I mean you don't see many girls buying men dolls. And people who get dolls to be their girlfriend either can't get  a girl OR their emotionally damaged.If you prefer dolls good for you, I'm not here to judge. Again no offense intended.ï»¿"
I think Bianca plays herself. This isn't unusual. Lots of actors play themselves.ï»¿
"Well i think Ryan looks to good for the role, even with this ugly beard. Apart from that, great movie.ï»¿"
