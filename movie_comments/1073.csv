"They give away WAY TOO MUCH in this trailer.  Don't have him looking at the newspaper that shows Robbins getting arrested for setting a bomb, don't show a bomb being detonated, don't show anything about bombing.  Show the paranoia.  Show Bridges being paranoid about his neighbor and some very select shots of Robbins being ambiguous.  Christ, trailer people.ï»¿"
