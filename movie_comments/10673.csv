"Greed-for lack of better word is-Good, greed is right, greed works, greed clarifies, cuts through and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all it's forms. Greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge- has marked the upward surge of mankind. And greed-you mark my words- will not only save teldar paper but that other malfunctioning corporation called the U.S.A.... thank you very much.Gordon Gekko.ï»¿"

"Gordon Gekko was a good man.  Bud Fox was ungrateful little cockroach.  The real criminals aren't people who bust out crap companies that no one is going to give a shit about in two years, the real criminals are the politicians who busted out this country and put us $19 trillion dollars in the hole and counting.  When are the politicians in Washington, D.C. going to get arrested for treason and put in orange jump suits?ï»¿"
u mad bra?ï»¿
Who do you think would get the blame and prison time once the sec came down on Gekko? he would have put it all on bud so he was using him to do the dirty work.ï»¿

"+WangDiddy82 i get your point, that's how the people wrote the script...gordon was the movie villian so they have him talk a lot of sense during the movie but then he's doing these underhanded things, setting up bud fox to take the fall...so i'm speaking generally not within the entire context of this oliver stone-written movie..ï»¿"

"And because they used to be poor, they likened the policy of high tax, big government spending, union or more factious, bribery, corruptions.  NYC is not your meritocracy, no sir, it have become a blend of capitalism icon surrounded by agents of socialism and communist.  Looked at today SP 500 corporations, (which are owned piece wise by funds, banks, and big pocket investors) looked at the CFO, CEO.  Dude, and you said it is not pride and prejudice, and factious?ï»¿"
"Is it like that in real life?  here goes the history lesson, after WWs, influx of immigrants to NYC, the city became factious than ever.  I mean looked at the people on Wall Street.  Do they looked like white to you?  I think most of the old timers moved their families to the Midwest, Chicago, and further west, leaving these people behind, who doesn't know how to run anything.  ï»¿"

@mansitopinta If you liked Wall Street 2 I am sure you will enjoy the first movie as well. It was made back in the golden yuppie-days of the 1980's and you also get to see alot more business and high finance than you do in the sequel. I love both movies though.ï»¿

"I agree that Hollywood has lost its creativity. Most of its ""Blockbusters"" are revisited 80's etc movies or direct adaptations of foreign films, which are renamed and packaged as original products (eg The Departed and the Chaser (more than likely). It's pretty sad, but some of the best movies being made today are from Asia or Europe, where budgets are lower but innovation is much higher. Not a coincidence. I hoped the recession would be good for films, but just bred more rehashes instead...ï»¿"

"Harping back to a time when hollywood made great films. I think Hollywood has lost it's creativity now and produces 10th rate movies now. You may find the odd exception but on the whole creativity and imagination not just in the movies has taken a nose dive. Poor acting, poor scripts, poor dialogue too much emphasis on special effects. The 80's although a decade of outrageous fashion and excess was a great decade for movies and music. Today bears no comparison it is boring and lifeless.ï»¿"
