I know Iâ€™m 8 years late but letâ€™s all chat about how wonderful this film is. Looking forward to everyoneâ€™s input and opinions!ï»¿
"SPOILERS QuestionWhy didn't Warrick kill him?  Even if he just loves the game, why leave it to chance?ï»¿"
I watched this last night on Netflix - pretty bad.ï»¿
"It was actually entertaining. If you are bored and were looking for something witty, this is it. It has more twist than a swiss roll.ï»¿"
"Does anyone know a movie that is really simular to this one i liked this movie , im looking for a special movie with a weird psyco llike this for example (not with guns or other unrealistic weird bullshit) HELP ME OUTï»¿"
The Shining.ï»¿
"iv'e already seen it and its the worst movie iv'e ever seen im sorry , and it ain't simular to this movie ..ï»¿"
You should really see ''The Creep'' trilogy.ï»¿
Langhope It's called CREEP.  It's not a trilogy yet is it?  Third one yet to come outï»¿
"TM3000 Well, planned trilogy.ï»¿"
Langhope I'm waiting for creep 3 to come out.  I liked this movie more than creep though hejejeï»¿
"TM3000 I still haven't seen Creep 2, but it's on Netflix. Is it better than the legendary first movie?ï»¿"
"Langhope Oh yes I think it's much better than Creep 1 ;) they're both good.  I like the Creep movies and I really liked this one too, The Perfect Hostï»¿"
"TM3000 Gonna check it out, thanks.ï»¿"
"This movie is amazing, if your a fan of dark comedy you'll enjoy this film.ï»¿"
LOVE THIS MOVIEï»¿
Really nice movie :D I had a great laugh!!ï»¿
"we should watch it again...together, how bout tonight @ 8? my place, Im throwing a party ;)ï»¿"
this movie is awesomeï»¿
Worst fukn movie cant bliv i watched it to the end_Ÿ˜_ï»¿
I cant BELIEVE youï»¿
Helen Reddy?ï»¿
so Julia wasn't real ?ï»¿
Nope she's a figment of Warwicks imaginationï»¿
Very bad idea to read the trailer comments before watching the movie _Ÿ˜¥ï»¿
this movie lolï»¿
This trailer is terrible and doesn't reflect the atmosphere of the film at all...ï»¿
"which is great because it would spoil the ""thing""ï»¿"
"hohohoh, buena peli, inesperada totalmente!! eso es lo mejoraunque la forma de caminar del teniente..... jajaajajajaï»¿"
"this was a good movies    this trailer is trashï»¿"
film is sooooo greeeeaaaatttt!!!!!!!  â™¥ï»¿
Niles!ï»¿
Where is Helen reddy ?ï»¿
black comedy...I never understand why Pierce didn't get his own show after Frazier...his character Niles was priceless.  A fine actor indeed.ï»¿
I love this version of Soul Sacrificeï»¿
@Sizzerup King no john was just able to peel off his slit throat like orange skinï»¿
this is a psychologial thriller. the music tries to make it seem like its a funny movie but there isnt one funny part.ï»¿
Pierce place an excellent role and is very convincing as a villain.ï»¿
More comedy than thriller really.ï»¿
Awesome movie! Go see it..ï»¿
I think the trailer is actually perfect. Totally sells you on the premise without giving anything away.ï»¿
CREAZYï»¿
most underrated movie of all time.ï»¿
"idk if this helps, and haha u wrote that 4 months ago, so this might be old news, but i just watched it on netflix through my ps3, so thats a way.ï»¿"
So did he really kill people or just put makeup on them? Was really good tho.ï»¿
This trailer is SHIT... this movie is BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!!!ï»¿
"THE HOST IS A COP AND THE GIRL PLAYED THE GUY AND STOLE THE MONEY, JUST THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW :)ï»¿"
"@CAJim2 I watched it, and I still can't tell!I THINK it was good.... but I'm not sure... It was odd.ï»¿"
shitï»¿
"@DrakesUncharted Man, I'm glad I didn't see his comment before I saw the movie. Delete that.ï»¿"
I can't tell is it a s*it movie or a skit of a s*it movie?ï»¿
@YouBritishTuber its hardly a secret..ï»¿
@Naypa11 what's /x/?ï»¿
"watch this fried, the movie is a huge tripï»¿"
"Who found this movie from /x/ ?ï»¿"
@MusicAfterSilence They are... Lol you actually thought they where real?ï»¿
@YouBritishTuber I hope thats a joke. Cause when I said that the movie wasn't even out yet. It was purely speculation and COME ON! It's totally obvious from the trailer!ï»¿
@MusicAfterSilence thanks for ruining this for me and othersï»¿
@MusicAfterSilence that's what i thought too :)ï»¿
This is an amazing movie very original I loved it ill give it 3 thumbs up and the guy from Frasier was absolutely fucking awesome omg i have a new respect for him as an actor ï»¿
This is a motherfucking crazy movie! ï»¿
brzdude06 just watched he was crazy for realï»¿
@MusicAfterSilence The longer trailer makes that pretty clearï»¿
"@TheMrlortie That's 0:53, and I think it's a cover of Soul Sacrifice by Santanaï»¿"
"""Can't kill me, I'm having a dinner party...""There is so much Niles in that lineï»¿"
If they don't eat tossed salad and scrambled eggs in this film....ï»¿
anyone know the name of the song at 1:53?ï»¿
@jta27 my thoughts exactlyï»¿
"Niles!!! hahahahaa...I always knew he had a ""mean"" streak in himThis reminds me of the Frasier episode where it seemed he was trying to hurt Martin so Daphne could stay in his house....I think i'm gonna pop in my Frasier DVD now :-Dï»¿"
@CAJim2 its a comiller or thriedy. =)ï»¿
how... odd.. ï»¿
Check the 2011 trailer linked under related videosï»¿
"@MusicAfterSilence  There's another trailer that shows this is exactly what's going on at the end of it.It's just the two of them.ï»¿"
@mapo11 umm thats the movie you fucking moron go watch some more trailers dumbassï»¿
@MusicAfterSilence no shit...ï»¿
@CAJim2 Both and doing it right. :)ï»¿
"I can't tell, is it a comedy or a thriller?ï»¿"
@mapo11 I've actually seen two versions of this trailer. One here and the one now on Apple's site. It seems a bit deeper than that but I still get that feeling.ï»¿
@djace5000 Yea cause theres also little clips of Warwick dancing himself. So it seemed obvious to me.ï»¿
@mapo11 Really. Cause after I posted I thought it was stupid cause of the obviousness. Any other explanation is stupid. Think about it why would his guests ignore his violence towards John.ï»¿
"@MusicAfterSilence No, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. You are an idiot.ï»¿"
Anyone considered that the other guests are actually in Warwick's head? Cause they don't react to his violence towards john and the scenes in between of the house empty seem to show this.ï»¿
limited showing july 1stï»¿
David Hyde Pierce at his (scary) best. anyone agree?ï»¿
@tigerzebra i really want to know too! but it seems like no one has a clue when its to be released.ï»¿
IMDB has the answers for you =D. . . . NOT!ï»¿
DHP looks awesome in thisï»¿
