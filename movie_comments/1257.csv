"I like how this trailer really doesn't give away the whole movie, it's actually super vague when you know how the movie unfolds, but gives you just enough to maybe want to see itï»¿"
I must watch again. I never realized that Lauren Graham was in this movie.ï»¿
Ahh! Harvey!ï»¿
Happy 10th anniversary!!ï»¿
lmao Love this Movie. Love Mandy Mooreï»¿
gona ask a real question here ! other then license to wed and a walk to remember does mandy moore have any other good movies ? i cant find any :(ï»¿
Thank you ! :)ï»¿
"""American Dreamz.""  She's brilliant in it.  One of my favorite movies.ï»¿"
"+David J. McGee o i own that movie , its really good :) thank you though :)ï»¿"
Are you people out of your god damned minds?  Have you ever seen a legitimately good movie?  Let me be blunt: no Mandy Moore movie is a good movie!  The only good part is when it's over and people forget about them!ï»¿
Hmm.  You bring up a valid point.  I think all our minds were changed today.ï»¿
Cool.ï»¿
"@Rachel Well, I guess that's your right.  If you don't want to have to think while watching a movie, then feel free to love these idiotic movies until the end of time.ï»¿"
"@Rachel some people just troll cause they are insecure , never mind this person , just negative energyï»¿"
@JACOB KENSINGTON But it's true.  These movies are hot garbage that don't require any thought on the viewer's part.  What a shame.ï»¿
"I haven't seen most of these movies so I can't speak for them, but I stand by ""American Dreamz.""   It's an incredibly sharp, biting satire of American politics and American entertainment.ï»¿"
"@David J. McGee If you would put in the effort, you could find better.  Here's the consensus on that ""satire"" mess: ""This overly silly satire aims at too many targets with arrows too dull to make relevant social commentary.""  If you want ""an incredibly sharp, biting satire of American politics and American entertainment"", go watch Idiocracy.  It really highlights how stupid the general public could end up given recent trajectory.ï»¿"
@Rachel So why not watch something that challenges you?  What a waste of time.ï»¿
"@Rachel ""once you watch a movie that makes you think you can't watch it again because you already know what's gonna happen.""  Congratulations.  That's one of the stupidest things I've ever read.  Also, I'm pretty sure you know what's going to happen in these non-thinking idiot movies.  Right?ï»¿"
"Come on, let's keep it civil.ï»¿"
If everyone stops responding to it then they will stop . So Rachel . Stop tryna win the war . U have nothing to gain from it and you are wasting your time . ï»¿
"@JACOB KENSINGTON Yeah.  Mandy Moore and her movies suck!  Thanks, Jakob!ï»¿"
"@Rachel 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Fight Club.  There Will Be Blood.Bread and circuses.ï»¿"
"I've seen ""Idiocracy""; I like it.  But I try not to let my opinion about something be too formed by the general consensus on it, otherwise I could hardly call it my own opinion.  And as far as ""American Dreamz"" goes, I disagree with the consensus.ï»¿"
@David J. McGee Then agree with me.  It sucks.ï»¿
"@Rachel Never underestimate the stupidity of the general public.  Thanks for the laugh, Raquel.ï»¿"
"It's not necessarily about being challenged every time you watch a particular movie, but there's something to be said for finding a movie that's so well constructed that you can enjoy it for its individual elements, and find new things to appreciate every time, even if you already know what's going to happen.  The best movies get better the more you watch them.ï»¿"

+Ella Fant Are you sure?ï»¿
@Emmy Gerard sureï»¿
@Ella FantÂ I was just wondering because you added that question mark that made you not sound so confident. lolï»¿
@Emmy Gerard Personality disturbances. Insert bad childhood clichÃ© here.ï»¿
"@Emmy Gerard Also, I crave mental acuity, something to embark upon. From this, I find myself easily confused. I like the name Milly? Milly is a name?ï»¿"
@Ella FantÂ This is all confusing to me but good luck to you. Â ï»¿
"@Emmy Gerard thank you tons. you know, it's easy to flatter yourself when you don't know whether or not you're risking anything.ï»¿"
"I liked the mom's ass the most.and did she say, grandma moses?ï»¿"

Why this movie makes me wanna vomit all over the floor? Because I Said So!ï»¿
+Josh Berman so what are you doing here?ï»¿
"I have a right to voice my opinion about what I like and don't like and most critics hated this movie and frankly how can I blame them, the question is what are YOU doing here?!ï»¿"
"Um, Harvey???ï»¿"
