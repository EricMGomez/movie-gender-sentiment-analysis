It's scary how this film makes you root for the bad guys.ï»¿
WHITE PEOPlES favourite movie..ï»¿
"The ending is a fucking pussy ending! I guess this zombie moron really worships human scum. I would of spent at least a million making all three of them very slowly... very...very slowly show them in the most agonizing pain possible with their white trash vermin bodies explode bit by... motherfucking bit!!!  Chunk by every little bloody chunk of their toxic cancer.. AIDS Ebola virus Ridden demonic bodies die. And I pray that this cunt who made this filth comes to the righteous end that...( IT ) deserves!!! Hhmm? Maybe I can see about making that happen ??? HA! HEH! HAR! Die... zombie... Twat!!!!!!!ï»¿"

Charlie manson and his girls set the trend for these movies.ï»¿
"who wasn't even there, you notice :)ï»¿"
"this is a awesome movie. this one is a lot better than the first movie house of 1000 corpses, don't get me wrong the first one is great it, a new horror cult classic as well as this one. you get to know the firefly clan a little more better in this movie and the human side of them. it's all about family. if rob zombie remade the texas chainsaw massacre it would look like this and i would not mind seeing him redo that horror movie. the acting is good and the directing is good and the story is good. keep them coming rob. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do rating 5/5ï»¿"

"What I like about this particular film is that it doesn't fall victim to most of the modern horror clichÃ©s like fake jump scares and loud noises, and the car not starting to scare people; it's Rob Zombie's version of the 1970s exploitation horror film with a raw grittiness to its filmmaking and morally ambiguous characters, as well as some great movie tributes and references.ï»¿"
