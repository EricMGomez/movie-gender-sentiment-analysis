"Why use humans as hosts, they could use animals from Earth.ï»¿"
"_Ÿ™Œ oh my goodness I thought Sigourney Weaver had played the greatest role yet when it came to aliens Resurrection. I freaking totally love this movie plus it's my top number 1 favorite alien movie ever. Also I was hoping that they would continue Sigourney Weaver as a clone but apparently they did not. I think they need to do another alien movie and start where they left off at where the whole crew got back to Earth. I'm curious who and what destroyed the Earth like that. Was it the Predators, the engineers, the aliens, or was another species that we don't know about.ï»¿"
I freaking love Alien Resurrection more than any other Alien movies that they did. There is just something about this movie that I love more than anything. I know there's a lot of people didn't like it and they do have their opinion we like what we like and we love what we love. And yes I know some people don't even like this movie that's them not me. I can't help it I totally love and I enjoy watching this Alien Resurrection more than any other alien movie that's out there today. I'm also going to pick up the alien box set this one I'm picking up is going to include all six alien movies on Blu-ray disc. Has all four movies that Sigourney Weaver did as Ripley + Prometheus and alien Covenant which is the new one. Cannot wait to pick up my alien Blu-ray disc box set. Not only that I cannot wait till the next alien movie comes out.ï»¿
shawn eldridge i think this film is underrated - I think the action is good and it's full of quirky characters.The script is way more fun than either Prometheus or covenant. I love the scene where Dominic pinon is stealing the ammo.ï»¿

The worst Alien's movie! Very far from the others.ï»¿
"No, it was great, only problem is that you are dumb.ï»¿"
Indeed. This one was totally shit.ï»¿
Can't wait for Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley to be a real match for a xenomorph.ï»¿

Better than Covenant.ï»¿
I'm super disappointed... but I have to agree with you.ï»¿
tcelikel shut up covenant even though not as good as alien and aliens maybe a little below alien 3 alien covenant is infinitely better than ressurectionï»¿
"I honestly expected to see a comment like this. Too bad you're wrong, I mean Alien Resurrection is complete wank, worst movie I've seen, besides the two AvP movies, even Prometheus and Covenant are better than this and they're not even particularly good either.ï»¿"
"You might be right, but I did enjoy Resurrection more than Covenant. I'm also a fan of Jean-Pierre Jeunet.ï»¿"
"No matter what you say, Prometheus is undeniably a good film. Perhaps not what fanboys expected, but it was goodï»¿"
Both Prometheus and covenant engineer made human humans made David humans thought engineer God and stupid creation destroy engineer means we destroy god our makers but why engineer wants to destroy human by virus?? Please anyone tell me before its too late david reache oragieï»¿
True and terribly sad.ï»¿
This is anything better than later Alien films.ï»¿
i love this part of alien <3ï»¿
I knew it - I never saw this sequel!  I'm gonna rent this soon as I can!!!ï»¿
A big mess... with lots of cliches.ï»¿
you just described Aliensï»¿
"Except at the time, Aliens invented THOSE cliches. hahaï»¿"
_Ÿ‘__Ÿ‘__Ÿ‘_ï»¿
this trailer shows so much about the movieï»¿
i love movieï»¿
I love lamp.ï»¿
So how many times did she die?ï»¿
The worst Alien movie at all... Ridley Scott and James Cameron's Alien are the two ones worth to be watchedï»¿
"You are an idiot. This movie was amazing. Alien, the first one, is probably my favorite of all time. Cameron's was good, fun, but not that scary. Too bad you are a moron. This movie was brilliant,but the days of movies like this are over, thanks to pea brains like you.ï»¿"
Cloda Ph The only bad Alien film is Covenantï»¿
So were some kinda Alien Resurection huh?ï»¿
0:11 the original heroesï»¿
This movie was fine until the last 5 minutes.ï»¿
very good movie...best of them all.ï»¿
I have to disagree with that completelyï»¿
"ThatÂ´s ok of course, all about oneÂ´s opinion but for me it is and then again if the other wasnt there you wouldnÂ´t have a clue what this one was about,...ï»¿"
I only have two favorite Alien movie's Alien and Aliens!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Those are the best in my opinion.ï»¿

Luv Milla Jovovich Who's Watching Alien: Resurrection Trailer This In December 2016ï»¿
I totally agree with youï»¿
"Luv Milla Jovovich i wouldnâ€™t say its the best, i didnâ€™t enjoy it as much. I know itâ€™s your opinion, and i fully respect that, but i enjoy the other ones more.ï»¿"
"I like the first one best,but this may be the second best.ï»¿"
"Alien, Aliens, Aliens vs Predatorï»¿"
BEST TRAILER of the Best Film SFï»¿
what??? this movie sucks!!!!ï»¿
"TrailerMusic France.31 this movies a peice of shit. They tried too hard.   The first two were great. 3 I honestly really like, I don't think it's as bad as everyone thinks. Prometheus just took way too long to get to what we actually wanted to see.ï»¿"
"No, you are stupid. Big difference.ï»¿"
