Captain Mal and Merle? this gotta be epic!ï»¿

Fat acceptance be like 1:10ï»¿
This is perhaps the best allegory for an abusive relationship I've ever seen.ï»¿

"god, when i watched this film, i was 14 years old. I could only understand how messed up this film was.ï»¿"
I saw this movie when I was 10 and after the movie my parents I was disgusted and my parents brought me to burger King like it was some Fucking jokeï»¿

"this is a awesome movie. i really enjoyed this movie i was not sure what to make of it when i saw it but it turned out to be pretty good. the creature effects were pretty sweet. the acting was good, the specials effects are good and i just love these creature films. good movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do rating 5/5ï»¿"
A Slither sequel is much needed.ï»¿
These good old nerative trailers dogeï»¿
thumbnail looks like mom's spaghettiï»¿
look it that is merle of the walking dead xDï»¿
once upon wonderland stole tht monsterï»¿
is there a game of this cuz should beï»¿
so slither is the first part of the mcu?ï»¿
weird how this is on gardians of the galaxy as a easter eggï»¿
this is what you call a slugfestï»¿
Pam Beesly and Merle Dixon had low standards back thenï»¿
"So the girl got bang by a zombie...That's some next level shitï»¿"
ZOMBIE! ZOMBIE! (preparing to attack)ï»¿
woah its merle from twdï»¿
Oh good! A disgusting horror movie starring Effie Trinket and Yondu Udonta! _Ÿ™„ï»¿
every woman in the world to me <3 i love this songï»¿
The walking dead season 8 ?ï»¿
I first saw this movie when I was 11 and I just noticed that Pam Beesly is in this.ï»¿
So that's why Buck knows how to deal with Hunters.ï»¿
Is the guy playing Grant the same guy who played Merle Dixon on The Walking Dead?ï»¿
"Harry BurkittHonestly.I thought it was that guy from ZOMBIELAND for a sec.ï»¿"

Slither.io the originalï»¿
"watched this when I was like 12, do not remember it being a comedy XDï»¿"
Definitely not a comedy. Lol.ï»¿
Typical 80's movementsï»¿
"""...much FUCKING worse."", that is!;Pï»¿"
its just a bee sting my ass_Ÿ˜¨ï»¿
remember this as a kid. got grossed out.ï»¿
"Maybe the worst movie ever made. Really a disaster under every points of view.Â Actors are a pain. Besides the scenes of nudity are totally censured. Why should you be afraidÂ to showÂ boobs in a movie like this? So, shit andÂ neither funny!ï»¿"
its a comedy lol probably costed like nothing to produce and they probably ma millions off itï»¿
Try to make a better movie than this your ownself. Almost every critic has given this movie a good reviewï»¿
Agree. Porn has much more these scenes. Why don't you just go to watch porn? :Dï»¿
"It doesn't have to be a porn for having some uncensored scene. The censure is unbearable. For example look atÂ Innocent BloodÂ of 1992 by John Landis, it was very more hilarious adÂ much better realized.ï»¿"
"^ I agree of what you said, basically.ï»¿"
u suck thoï»¿
Didnt even know this was a comedy back thenï»¿
"yeah,, me too.. i thought it was a straight up horror film... but it has the legit chilling and nightmarish stuff in it thats why we thought it was a full packed horrorï»¿"
I first watched it on video back-to-back with Tremors. They are both action/horror movies with a lot of humor to relieve the tension. Lots of good lines in both!ï»¿
0/11 would not bangï»¿
OMG I REMEBER SEEING THE TRAILER FOR THIS WHEN I WAS LIKE FIVE AND THEN EVERYTIME SHE TRIED TO HIVE ME A BATH I WOULD SCREAM AND RUN AWAY FROM HER. I FINALLY FOUND IT.ï»¿
"NO IM ACTUALLY RELATING TO THIS SO MUCH, I SAW THE BATH SCENE WHEN I WAS SIX AND HAD NIGHTMARES ABOUT IT FOR ACTUAL YEARS AND NOW I FINALLY FOUND ITï»¿"
I used to be scared of the cover for this film.ï»¿
this movie almost made me vomit when i was 8 years oldï»¿
Still hard to believe that it was a comedyï»¿
Pritiman Dasï»¿
"Hilarious!! One of the funniest movies of all time, wouldn't even scare a little girl.ï»¿"
I remember watching this maybe as a kid or do I have the wrong movie? Either way watching this it was just disgusting for me not really horror but it did give me the creeps of it in the bath tubï»¿
LOL i couldnt stop laughing at this movie its so bad...ï»¿
It's a comedy.ï»¿

"@Thomas CÂ lol ikr just something soo disturbing and disgusting about it..like when i watched it, it was on daytime TV and i really am pissed at whoever allowed that to happen paha! no other film has affected me like this one, usually when films have this much gore you just get used to it but the combo of flesh and worms and tentacles and the farm setting just got under my skin (ew fml) in this oneï»¿"
