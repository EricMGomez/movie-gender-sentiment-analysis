"Since day this film movie came out, still love this film movie 100%.  Wish put this on blueray DVD and soundtrack together.   Have book and dvd.  Hard find in stores today??.  One greatest actors and directors did a fantastic job of this film movie 100%.ï»¿"
I've been thinking bout this movie for months and couldn't thank of it till nowï»¿
They used to play this on TV for freeï»¿
went to college I was thinking I can maybe be a photographer Lexi's weddingï»¿
Brownie Proline Cherry and Baby Ruth I know that Willie Jack walked out on you but that what makes him trash not you Forney holding Americus Lexie: forney's in love with you Novalee: Forney different from us heï»¿
I love that Lexie: you're a big celebrity everybody want to talk to the mother of the Walmart baby Novalee if I was you I would have rolled out of career and broadcasting them I'll call my kids after snack foodsï»¿
Even this is white privilege...LMFAO!ï»¿
OMG i remember having to go see this at the movies back in 2000 ugg lolï»¿
I love this film.ï»¿
"That is fascinating the fact that most comments about this trailer were written by females. I strongly believe we all should get together and ""rewatch"" it in my house. Popcorn on me!ï»¿"
I love Natalie Portman.ï»¿
It's funny they couldn't say fornication in a movie trailer from 2000.ï»¿
So fucking underrated!ï»¿
Oh i haven't watched this movie in year. It actually came out when i was only 5ï»¿
need this movieï»¿

"I was sorta bored. I thought it was predictable, and she made me mad falling for the same bull when her baby's barely a month old...? Why wouldn't you do a background check when you have so much to lose? Or at least ask around about the guy, come on... also not hot about the store name being shoved around, and the family's notoriously cheap, particularly for being about the wealthiest around. 500.00 is more insult than being nice. That's like anyone else flinging a dollar at her. And a job offer? How can you support yourself and a kid on that salary? I dunno, I've been to these little places, and they're not usually so...utopia-like. They often have a very bad drug or alcohol problem, because you can't do anything on the one large corporate store salary mentioned here. You can't live on that salary without government $$$. It destroys small businesses. That company bleeds small towns to death, then moves on, no problem.ï»¿"
This is the movie my parents got my name from lolï»¿
I read the book as wellï»¿
One of my favorite movies I have watched this so many times and I still love it and me and my aunt Dana have watched this movie so many times together I remember seeing this movie when I was in kindergarten with my aunt Dana I think lolï»¿
"Luckily Obi Wan took over those baby's.. Wait, seriously I thought this movie was made in 2010... but its actually older. I love it.ï»¿"

James Davis No.ï»¿
Where my heart is? Somewhere with that movie and Natalie Portman's flmography in general.ï»¿

Did something happen to the little girl?ï»¿
"I wonder why Walmart didn't know she was there. After all, there should have been cameras throughout the store.ï»¿"
+Angel Walker It's a movie don't question it's logicï»¿
+PrincessFluffyCow __ Nothing logic about it. That's what makes it stupid.ï»¿
"@Angel WalkerÂ Sure it's logic isn't very good, but I don't think the movie is stupid. I actually like the film very much.ï»¿"
"It's a field good movie. It's not supposed to be questioned it's just supposed to make you smile, and bring an escape from this tragic and mundane life of ours.ï»¿"
+Figs3 *feel good movieï»¿
Its a walmart in BFE Oklahoma in the year 2000. No guarantee there would be cameras.ï»¿
"Places don't usually check security cameras unless there's pretty noticeable evidence of theft or otherwise, but Novalee was pretty good with covering her tracks. Plus this was 2000 or possibly earlier, so maybe not all WalMarts had cameras yet.ï»¿"
I told a manager at my local walmart about this movie and she was pretty sure there were several people living at her walmart.ï»¿
"The film stars out in the mid-'90s (around 1995 I believe, it's briefly mentioned on Americus' birth certificate), so not all places might have had them at that time. The book actually starts out in the summer of 1987 and continues into 1994.ï»¿"
@Angela Moulton Were there?ï»¿
I think she was joking.  But she was half serious.ï»¿
"Love the book so much more then movie!  The book had her being superstitious of the number seven, why does the movie have the number five?ï»¿"
"Love the book so much more then movie!  The book had her being superstitious of the number seven, why does the movie have the number five?ï»¿"
Is it true that novalee and forney do not get married in the book?ï»¿
Love the movieï»¿
Fave film everï»¿
"Both the book and movie are incredible, I would recommend each a thousand times. A great story for the soul. ï»¿"
Mais ou menosï»¿
its a song that plays in the trailer that I am looking forï»¿
"Â  Â Hey, can anyone tell me the name of the piano track (ost) that is playing on the funeral after tornado?ï»¿"
Esa pelÃ_cula es tan triste :cï»¿
I love this movieï»¿
"Watched the movie when it 1st came out, Just recently finished the booklike the movie better.ï»¿"
Sameï»¿
whats the song on the ending credits ... the 1st one . anyone know ?ï»¿
This movie was in my childhood. Reading the book in my Parenting class. Brings back memories c:Â ï»¿
pretty sure they are both trashï»¿
Why is she trash? She doesnt do anything remotely trashy... just the scum guys in the movie including the abuser who shouldve ended up in jailï»¿
"Sam Smith well, she didn't exactly make sure she knew what she was getting into, right? She just did it, without any thought and no logical plan. You'd think the first time getting burned would have shown her, but nooo...lol. I think peolle have to take responsibility, particularly since abusive people are extremely obvious once you use your mind. One trick they pull is ""the carrot."" Like dangling a carrot in front of a mule to make him work, but never giving him what you promised. As in, ""When this or that happens, I'll come thru on my part,"" which they never do. Or the other one, is where they threaten you with not giving you something if you don't do this or that. You're smart, with two brain cells to rub together, you see anything like that and you bolt. America's problem is too much garbage and not enough using the library and what you learn there. Brainwashing and abusive people's MO (whether a partner or not) is all right there. Start with ""Why does he DO that"" (inside the minds of angry and controlling men) by Lundy Bancroft, and go from there. He spells out how abusive people all act, like from the same script. You could ask around for someone's personal experience,  and it's real close to what's in the book, what I just said. But seriously, those people are never the stereotype whatever. They're nice much of the time as it suits them. Their moods go in cycles: build up, explosion (with or without physical assault, which pops up at some point) and the sweetheart phase, where they do the super nice person to rope you back in because a replacement fool isn't as easy to come by as it was. Then they'll get mean, rude, snotty, snap again, and it repeats. It's partly your own fault for jumping in and not knowing for a fact who you're dealing with, but no matter how stupid you WERE, that's no reason to STAY there.ï»¿"
Salem Saberhagen so are uï»¿
Love this movie:) the trailer doesn't do it much justiceï»¿
The news about a boy found living in a Walmart in Corsicana brought me here lolï»¿

"you are soooooooo wrong...--Mikeï»¿"
BM wow literally me lolï»¿
"In the scene in which Novalee is running into the parking lot, to learn her jackass boyfriend left her behind, look at the upper left corner as she's coming thru the door, you can CLEARLY see her alter ego looking back at you on a Star Wars poster inside the store. Yes, Padme is clearly seen! You really have to look tho, rewind and pause a couple time, and you'll see it :)ï»¿"
I got this movie last week. GreatÂ filmï»¿

"Screw it. I'm pissed. My cousin sleeps on the floor above me. I'm bothered because he just became really good at obtaining females. The guy found the Master Attraction site by Jake Ayres (Look in Google). All he's doing now is fucking women. He's consistently having the hottest women back and I hear it, which is gross and If only he had not found that site. I am envious!ï»¿"

"Life sucks. My buddy has begun seeing a 10 because 2 months ago he signed up to a site named Master Attraction (Google it if you want to know more.) I'm so envious because I would like to fall in love as well. How come it's so difficult? I'm gonna take a peek at this Jake Ayres man's material. Crazy point is, my friend used to have Zero success with women. How can you improve that fast? His girl's like a model...ï»¿"

"This is a Conservative movie.  One that promote values, doing the right thing, perseverance, picking yourself up from your bootstraps, community helping one another. The setting of Oklahoma.The opposite is watching a movie about Anna Nicole Smith or watching new Jersey shore, A godless society where anything goes and the state gives the unwed mother welfare Promoting a low self esteem society.  A victim focused unfair society.  California, New York, Chicago.ï»¿"
"JDK K lol when i seen this movie i just thought 'if they showed this at a nascar race who was handing out free PBR and was sponsored by skoal this would be the epitome of uneducated small minded trailer trashPlus if you care about your values why do you condone a unwed 17 year old having sex?Isnt that a sin?Isnt she going to hell allready?ï»¿"

"Some don't, there are a lot of Wal-Marts that have regular business hours. Whether it's 24hrs depends on the location. A small town like Sequohah wouldn't need a 24hr Wal-Mart. Plus, this story takes place in the 90s so 24hr Wal-Marts weren't as common.ï»¿"
I was surprised the wal-mart in this movie closed at 9pm thought wal-mart was open 24hours.ï»¿
"@MsLlcools, your wrong she has worked with many people of different cultures and backgrounds. She is also of Israeli descent, born in Israel and raised in the US, she still goes to the Middle East each year and has several charities to help others. So what if she dated one type of man, that's her preference. You need to check your facts before you insults or make such rude comments. You miss are trash.ï»¿"

"If you are considering watching this film, please dont let the whack trailer fool you. I LOVE this movie :) I have seen it about 4 or 5 times now. The trailer makes the story look Corney & they are trying to put a comedy feel to it. This movie is everything but comedy to me, it does make you feel good but it also shows allot about reality. I give this movie 10 stars haha because 5 isnt enough. This film will make you laugh, cry & feel a sense of joy somehow. And acting was amazing! :) ï»¿"
"This is like the best movie ever.It is a oldie, but goodieï»¿"
"the funny thing is, the very minute I finished this book, I went downstairs to watch TV and this was just starting...great dayï»¿"
I thought the movie was good. ï»¿
"It's out of synchï»¿"
"@weekendwarrior97 i think that was the point. i'm not really sure, i got pretty confused at some parts, but i think new dramatic things kept happening because there was a ""5"" involved with each one. overall, i believe this movie was very touching and really worth the watch.ï»¿"
I LOVE the book! ï»¿
I'm watching the movie right now LOVE it !!!ï»¿
i love this movieï»¿
Gotta love those trailers that give you the entire plot of the film. ï»¿
"judging by the trailer, the movie doesn't seem to be half as good as the book is. Not at all as I imagened it would be. But I will give it a chance :Dï»¿"
I love this movie it is so good...ï»¿

"Great movie, it is even better when you skip Willy Jacks parts!  He just ruins the movie, once he leaves her at Walmart he's gets cut...ï»¿"

her mom is so messed up in the movieï»¿
i l000ve this movieï»¿
Is this movie based on a true story?ï»¿
Natalie Portman's best movie ever...although V For Vendetta comes in second. And I wouldn't call her boyfriend a dreamer...more like a selfish dink. What kind of man abandons a pregnant girl in the middle of nowhere like that? Ugh.ï»¿
"Eh...I don't think the commercial really does the film justice. They tried to make it seem too uplifting...they should of focused on the emotional aspect of the first part. Horrible music choice, and it made it seem like an infomercial for Wal Martï»¿"
"I love this movie! I'm reading the book to, so far so good.ï»¿"
I love the book!ï»¿
"Movie is great, but the sound doesn't match up with the video in this clip. Not worth 5 stars.ï»¿"
not one of natalies most famous movies but indeed one of her best.ï»¿
"I'm having a assignment about reading this book, and I just love it. I did not know that they had made this book. So right now I just feel excited.ï»¿"
im reading the book right now and it is great. i just hope the movie is as good too.  but likely the books are always better than the movies;ï»¿
"I really enjoyed this pic, she is soo sweet.ï»¿"
