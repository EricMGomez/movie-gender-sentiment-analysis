James Gleason was a well-regarded character actor for decades.ï»¿
Excellentï»¿
"He not only sells this song, he drives it home and installs it.ï»¿"
"What a fantastic clip. With good sound and picture quality, and perfect sync, from 1929. Amazing!ï»¿"
"My father was part of a rapid-precision tap act back in the mid-20's.Â  Though I never heard himÂ mention this song, it always embodies that era to me.Â  One song he alwaysÂ did sing was ""Bye, Bye, Blackbird,"" which also conjures up that era.ï»¿"
nitwit...you imagining things...stop it.ï»¿
"Anyone ever figure out who the guitarist really is? CLEARLY not even close to being Lang, almost looks Spanish.ï»¿"
There is film of Lang on YouTube. I was going to ask the same question myself. It is unusual to see a player of that era in this type of music playing a flat top.ï»¿
I'd ask the same question about the clarinetist.ï»¿
I looked up Eddie Lang.  Saw a picture.  The face DOES look like Eddie Lang.ï»¿
"I looked at the Internet Movie Database entry for this movie.  It does show Eddie Lang as an ""Uncredited Guitarist"".  Therefore I assume it is, in fact, Eddie Lang.ï»¿"
"It can't be Lang.  He had a full head of black hair and didn't wear glasses.  This guitarist â€” whoever he is â€” also appears in ""The Saturday Night Kid,"" a Paramount movie of the same year.ï»¿"
It looks nothing like Lang. He is an older man than Lang and not as good a player.ï»¿
Herb Nacio Brown would be the heavy set fellow with the mustache....ï»¿
The great music and movies of the 1920's and 1930's! What an era!ï»¿
"Ah, what an era!ï»¿"
Loved this movie! :)ï»¿
Good number!ï»¿
It all depends on how you look at it. Women did not have to do degrading nude scenes in movies at this time and there were actually more female writers in the golden age then there are today. ï»¿
"I agree with you one hundred percent.  I remember in an interview, Anita Page said she shocked audiences in the bathroom scene, because she was naked in it, even though she was in the bathtub.ï»¿"
"The casting couch has existed as long as Hollywood has, I would consider that pretty degrading :/ï»¿"
"I just watched the clip, and if you listen closely, he says ""buck"".ï»¿"
"There's a scene which sounds like it has the F word, am I right? I's a scene at the birthday party, and the guy who stutters offers the girl a drink. He says something like 'It'll f--- you up'. I'm not sure if I heard it correctly. Anybody have any ideas?ï»¿"
"But remember that for the award that year, it was up against The Hollywood Revue-- which was just that-- a revue of musical numbers with no story. At least The Broadway Melody had a plot!ï»¿"
"Ever since I saw the 2001 Best Picture winner, Chicago, I have wondered what the reaction would have been in 1929, had an audience that was seated in a theater to watch The Broadway Melody, were instead shown Chicago--- another musical about their own time period, but made 73 years later. If The Broadway Melody made their jaws drop, imagine what Chicago would have done.ï»¿"
"It isn't completely awful, although I would quibble about ""Best Picture"", however, I will give it a bit of a pass, as Hollywood is still learning how to make sound movies.  ""Applause"", from the same year, is better.  Kudos to this movie for having an unconventional ending, though.ï»¿"
"Charles King, Jr, also known as Charlie,  was Charles King's son who was married to my sister.  Charles King, Jr. was such a handsome man who had a strong resemblance to his father and to Hal Holbrook.  Charlie King, Jr. sent this movie to me on VHS years ago.  The stories of Charles King, Sr. are quite intriguing.  What a wonderful movie that graced the screen in a simpler time.  Ahhhh to have lived then....ï»¿"
"What a piece of crap this movie was. And to think it got a Best Picture. It's a shame it was placed on the same level with old classics like All Quiet on the Western Front, It Happened One Night, Wings etc.  ï»¿"
"Musicals obviously could not exist before Al Jolson sang 'Mammy', in 1927. During the first 2 or 3 yrs of talkies, however, Hollywood produced many gaudy backstage stories & all-star spectacles that the genre quickly wore  out its welcome.ï»¿"
"During the early ""talkies"" years, I think the studios were trying to figure out how to use the new medium rather than just the plot or story line of the pictures.  The 1940's and 1950's were really the ""golden age"" of the movie musicals, especially at MGM and it's ""Arthur Freed Unit"".ï»¿"
i dont know why i love this corney crap..but i do!ï»¿
Ah.  I concur. ï»¿
"Are you referring to the dialog, because the entire film exists.  By the way, it doesn't have a completely happy ending, either.  Not a great film, but certainly not a bad one.ï»¿"
The full film still exists.  It's on DVD.ï»¿
Those two girls singing at 0:40 are the cutest things! My my my.ï»¿
Does anyone know any possible way to view the full film?ï»¿
I love it !!!!!!ï»¿
Another great long forgotten by Hollywood of today.........ï»¿
"I really enjoy seeing how the fairly-new technology of sound is so well used here. At the start, the disorganized jumble of various musical styles gets across the hectic atmosphere of this office where all sorts of competitors are vying for attention. Then, when ""Broadway Melody"" begins, the various instruments join in as the curious onlookers gradually pay attention and get enthusiastic. ï»¿"
"yes, errolfan, that is james gleason on the right of the guitar  player with the cigarette. he was a great character actor.ï»¿"
@Bobolink03 Grauman's Chinese premiered it.ï»¿
"@dudemantwo He was huge on Broadway in the teens, twenties and thirites.  He didn't like Hollywood much and went back to the stage.  He died in Europe while entertianing troops during World War Two.ï»¿"
"That's Nacio Herb Brown at the piano. He composed all the music for Broadway Melody, along with Arthur Freed.ï»¿"
Still true today!  A great film then and now.ï»¿
"Going Hollywood has ""Temptation"", right? Fantastic song!ï»¿"
"I love Rosie!Actress Charlotte Merriam dances the Charleston nicely!ï»¿"
What a fantastic period piece...and in such good quality.  Thank you for this video.  FIVE STARS!ï»¿
"1936 , 1938 and 1940 I see them in LD when I was young. I prefer 1936 because I love to hear that movie's song.ï»¿"
And how! :)ï»¿
"You're correct! That's not Eddie Lang, my mistake :)ï»¿"
"Was that a nice thing to say bout GMC? I mean, was it meant nicely? (great clip!)ï»¿"
where is eddie lang? he's not the guy playing the guitar on king's left....james gleason played character parts on many movies...good actor.ï»¿
"Apparently, it IS Eddie Lang. playing the guitar.ï»¿"
The film if you get a chance to see it (you can rent it at you library) is quite good but I don't think all scenes are available in what is left  - time has eroded some.........ï»¿
"however, I love to see 1936 version.ï»¿"
