1:36 HELLO-!ï»¿

"Hopefully there is a Stan lee cameo...R.I.Pï»¿"
;-;ï»¿
When is it coming December 14 or Christmasï»¿
is spider-man 2099 in this movie?ï»¿
1:40 WHY DID YOU HAVE TO RUIN ITï»¿
Octavio Percivaldi how did that ruin itï»¿
The guy who voices peter is nick from New Girl!!!ï»¿
HOW DOES HE NOT REMEMBER GWEN YOU WERE BEST FRIENDS YEARS AGO REMEMBER??ï»¿
"sigPlayzRoblox nothing indicates that he doesnâ€™t remember, it still could be in the movieï»¿"
why is he the same age from the disney xd version. and peter is all grown up. help me understandï»¿
sigPlayzRoblox because why notï»¿
Amazing movie. I try draw Gwen Tracy and her team in my channel guys. Search YouTube: spider Gwen studio atistika. I was draw Miles Morales tooï»¿
I first saw the trailer in theaters! I love John Mulaney!!âù_ï¸è_Ÿ’™ï»¿
Letâ€™s actually just replace all white male actors with every major role with either a woman or literally any other race .... I mean it would just be considered racist otherwiseï»¿
huh?ï»¿
Dube Za replace? This is a different character from an alternate universe.ï»¿
Finally we see a black Spidermanï»¿
Miles has been around since before thd whole childish gambino thingï»¿
Sheâ€™s pengï»¿
Time to neco Stan Leeï»¿
"Anime grill, sold.ï»¿"
If Silk is in this gotta rate it PG13 Maybe R due to Pete's and her pheromonesï»¿
"TheBeastly Champ No, thatâ€™s not even close enough to get it PG13. Let alone R.ï»¿"
"@szeax if you read the comic Cindy and Pete get bit frisky time to time, they where both bit by the same spider causing them to have the same pheromones thus attracting them a bit more to each other. So PG 13 rated due to/if Cindy will be addedï»¿"
2:28 Wakanda?ï»¿
"For all Peni Parker lovers...I present to you the replay button!!1:37ï»¿"
Where supaidaman at my boi leopardon and takuyaï»¿
Is it actually stop motion or cgi?ï»¿
Cheeky Bum cgiï»¿

I love how they're in their own art styleâù_ï»¿
I got a trailer before a trailerï»¿
Spider Porker my childhood heroï»¿
why the video look like its lagging.....ï»¿
"Not seeing this.Because The Amazing Spider-Man, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, and Spiderman Homecoming. Is better.ï»¿"
"EWicken you know.. how? You havenâ€™t seen this movie, how do you know itâ€™s bad?ï»¿"
This looks like a curious movie like if u agreeï»¿
"Can't wait for watching this spider vers!!! For the note spider Chan beautifully awesome Mantulll Mantab jiwaaaï»¿"
"This movie was doing great, until Peter porker showed up.ï»¿"
Yung Butterstick and that helped the salesï»¿
The name of the song?ï»¿
They should also include Megal O'Hara: Spider-Man 2099 in this movie. Don't you think?ï»¿
Factsï»¿
"""why are my frames dropping?""ï»¿"
i got the same ad.ï»¿
When is it coming out ????ï»¿
I HAVE TO SEE THISï»¿
Peter Parker stills love Mary Jane Watson  and not Gwen Stacy and they share a kiss which looks like a scene from spider man 1 he has a picture of her so that proves Mary Jane Watson the one for Peter Parker take that Gwen Stacy and Parker other love interestï»¿
Ryan Rodgers noï»¿
szeax what do you meanï»¿
1:39 look be hind ant may / spider may lol and you see the ps4 spider man symbolï»¿

I liked that they made the 616 spider-man an middle age man.ï»¿
"I thought this movie looked trash, BUT NOW IM PUMPED UP!!!!ï»¿"
I'll be looking for a Stan Lee Cameo...May be for the last time.ï»¿

before watching this I got an ad... for into the spiderverse... nice job YouTubeï»¿
+1 for piggy spiderï»¿
I wanna like this but it looks like they mixed CG with stop-motion and that just kills it for meï»¿
masterofinfinity479 itâ€™s just CG... It just seems like stop motion because of how choppy it is.ï»¿
"for some reason, peter looks like default guyï»¿"
"In that last scene Peni Parker isn't sticking to the ceiling with her hands like the others. I guess she doesn't have spider powers like the others, she just drives that power suit.ï»¿"
"Kindred Vids well, itâ€™s pretty known that she doesnâ€™t have standard powers.ï»¿"
"I stopped watching this shitty trailer after seeing the BLACK peter parker.... Seriously, I'm not being racist here. I think we are just going too far to appease the lower class race. Enough is enough! What's next? are we going to have a Spider Muslim or Spider Jihad?ï»¿"
"Oz One canâ€™t tell if this is a joke or nah, but thatâ€™s not peter Parker. His name is miles, has been in comics for awhileï»¿"
Oz One stop.ï»¿
There are two white Peter Parkers in this trailer. Tf you talking about?ï»¿

I would've liked it better if it was live action with Tom Holland and maybe Michael B Jordan as Miles Moralesï»¿

"""The truth is... I knew a Gwen Stacy in my universe.""I'd never have imagined that this movie would actually get me emotional.ï»¿"
Yees Spider-Man noirï»¿
So so? They're fucking delicious and a mystery to find outside of ice cream men.ï»¿
#SONYKILLS #WHYSONY #UFAKEDMJï»¿
No one wondering how there gonna deal with the fact spider noir flat out kills people and fit it into a kids movieï»¿
Cade Washa the same way they fit deadpool into Spider-Man cartoons.ï»¿
@szeax so by making him lameï»¿
"Cade Washa no, deadpool was still pretty cool there.ï»¿"
"uhhhh..you are aware that you should not feel guilty for slavery man..... having a black Spiderman is so fucking wrong bro.what's next .....white guy playing tchalla.I been collecting comics since 1984ï»¿"
"Safet Cucaj but it is not Peter Parker whoâ€™s black itâ€™s just Miles Morales , who became Spider Man.Btw, there were white Black Panthers.ï»¿"
"Wait, so you have been collecting comics since 1984 but yet you seem not to know that Miles exists in the Comics since like 9 years, or am i not getting something here? ( Plus it's Spider-Man and not Spiderman)ï»¿"
Safet Cucaj also there is a white tchalla lmaoï»¿
"""I've been collecting comics since 1984""Seems you don't read them since you don't know that Miles has existed for almost a decade at this pointï»¿"
He reminds me so much of junior _Ÿ˜“âù_ï¸è R.I.P âù_ï¸èï»¿
why tf is he black? what a desperate attempt to please liberals. Its so forced to just create a black character to be spider man like this.ï»¿
Aura Companion please tell me youâ€™re trollingï»¿
"Miles has been a character in the comics since 2009. Also, There are three spider-men in this movie, two of them being whiteï»¿"
Im finna clap peni parker _Ÿ˜è_Ÿ˜è_Ÿ˜èï»¿
subzero8901 I genuinely hope your grave gets pissed onï»¿
"Hey, does anyone notice that Peni Parker in 2:22 is holding her skirt down?ï»¿"
"Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig, does whatever a Spider-Pig does.ï»¿"
Niceï»¿
From all the scenes of Peter Parker it seems he's like Tobey Maguire.ï»¿
Mr stark I don't feel so goodï»¿
Just got an ad for this movie!ï»¿

"szeax look, just because I have a different opinion on something doesnâ€™t make me blind. I just donâ€™t like stupid jokes and plots that look retarded, but hey maybe other people like that kind of stuff.ï»¿"
It looks great!ï»¿
Spidermans black?ï»¿
Kaaniman this one is.ï»¿

I had an ad for this adï»¿
LOL GOT SPIDERVERSE AD AND THOUGHT I WAS WATCHING THE REAL THING!ï»¿
I can see a detail on Milesâ€™ hip on his suitï»¿
I'm hyped but this made me cringe a bit. Like why did they make spidergwen do all these ballerina moves idk it's weirdï»¿
"What ""balleria moves"" those are spiderman moves scrubï»¿"
"Ah yes, the classic ballerina move where they fucking swing into alternate universes and fight crime.ï»¿"
"@Dieselnaut 3.0 look at 1:45 the way she lands. And she's also wearing ballerinas, scrubï»¿"
@Lex_ I dont think ballerinas land like that when they jump off a buildingï»¿
TAY K GOT OUTTA PRISON YOï»¿
"Justified Slash PUT DOWN THE GUN, TAY.ï»¿"
I don't know if anyone else noticed that it looks to me like there's less frames per second.ï»¿
Nobody talking about the fact that we finally got a black Spiderman I'm so proudï»¿
"Nobodys talking about it cause miles has been around for years, everyone knows him already, weve had a black spiderman for agesï»¿"
1:04 inflation is ridiculous in this universeï»¿
I dont remember anime being in the Disney XD showï»¿
HeyThatsMe _ because that show picked a different group of charactersï»¿
What song is thisï»¿
Sorry I was there when Amazing Fantasy #15 first hit the stands. There has never been a decent Spider-Man movie.ï»¿
The Joker no. Thatâ€™s just wrong.ï»¿
You definitely weren'tï»¿
Ok we are seeing black Spiderman and black Pokemon master in Pokemon detection Pikachu !!! All for colour representation â™¥ï¸è. When is Indian Spiderman coming ??! I am waiting....ï»¿
This isnt a new characterï»¿
Is it just me or does anyone realize that at 2:18 Peter's sounds like the sound of Tobey Maguire_Ÿ˜± even at 0:58 and 1:02 too!ï»¿
It's like shattered dimensions.ï»¿
I. Got a. Spider-Man adï»¿
"Spiderman is now a LoliLadies and Gentlemen, we got 'em.ï»¿"

"Alright this looks cool but it's really confusing. I mean what universes are peter and miles from? Is this Earth-616 Spider-Man and Earth-1610 Spider-Man or did they create a whole new multiverse? If so, are all of those universes have their own Earth numbers? It's really bugging meï»¿"
Ozan GÃœNER it doesnâ€™t matter.ï»¿
"If it isn't in comic form, it isn't 616. Also, 1610 is gone dude.ï»¿"
"@UniqueNameGuy i don't agree. although it's clearly not 616 Spider-Man, i still think if it fits the 616 canon, it could very well be 616 Spider-Man. And i know 1610 was destroyed but Spider-Verse storyline takes place before that happenedï»¿"
@szeax well it does to me. I'm really interested in this multiverse thingï»¿
"@Ozan GÃœNER I say this can't be 616, not because it doesn't fit the canon (although it doesn't) but because every tv show, movie and game involving Spider-Man is an alternate universe. Regardless of how closely it approximates another universe, if it isn't told in the comics with main spidey, it isn't main canon. Though I doubt it'll be made into a comic, all of these characters are alternate versions of the alternate versions in the comics. Another thing to point out is that time passes at the same speed in all universes but Peter and Miles are nowhere remotely similar in age and Peni is too young. It wouldn't make sense for these to be the official versions of these charactersï»¿"

I just hope they allow every character it's screen time, not just focus on the other guys when the main center is Miles, or too be focused too much on Miles and the other characters to be just as supporting cast!ï»¿"

"Christian Jardin All the things you listed exist, pal.ï»¿"
@szeax in a hypothetical world anything is impossible. But it's non-sensical to view Storm as White just because there's a multi verse. Character development just goes out the window. It becomes chicken scratch if you will.ï»¿

KmpKingTM 843 i dont care  if hes miles all i care is that the character is a fken negger !ï»¿
@Cuban Richh lol ok and? Still didnt state the problem at hand skeez _Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
"@KmpKingTM 843  Meh, it's about forced political correctness. If this movie came out 5 years ago, no one would've cared about that. But as you know,  recent years have been forcing everyone to become either 1. A member of LGQBT 2. A member of a miniority group 3. Of a different race (Other than white) or 4. Being a female. For example, I didn't watch Black Panther 2018 because it's so full of politics (Which spoiled it for me), yet I was a big fan of Black Panther comics and cartoons growing up. So it kills it for me when people suggest James Bond or the example with Ghost Buster 2016 either needing or having a female or black person because certain people are yelling ""poor black people and females"".ï»¿"
@Dan yes I understand where your coming from my guy.  But miles has been in the comics for years now.  It's only until now he's been put into a movie.ï»¿

"But Stan Lee did a lot for the Marvel Universe in general. He created it. While this might be a spider-man video, they aren't only remembering his contribution to spider-manï»¿"
"@UniqueNameGuy  He didn't create Marvel Universe. The universe was already established in 1940 with crossover between Human Torch and Namor, year before Stan Lee wrote his first story. And when we are talking about creation of Avengers, Fantastic Four and all others characters that got popular in 60s, they were created in collaboration with Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and others. In fact, when Kirby left the company in 1970, Lee suddenly stopped writing stories at all.ï»¿"
@AluTheHungryGhost A crossover between 2 characters does not equate to a universe in and of itself.  The fact that he established many different characters and tgeir relations to each other in a shared world is the point.ï»¿
"@UniqueNameGuy  It does. It establishes that those two characters exist in the same world. They were followed by lots of other crossovers and even creation of superhero team ""All-Winner Squad"" which had Captain America, Bucky, Miss America, Destroyer, Human Torch and Toro, Whizzer and many other heroes, with relationships( although not that significant, because you know, 40s). Furthermore we had characters like Citizen V, Thunderer,  the Finand other characters from ""Daring Mystery Comics"" series which also existed in the very same world.ï»¿"

I'm pretty sure this is another Gwen, or it could just be another character altogether. I'm imagining her as the sitting in the tree comics where the two get married, or marvel could be using some Earth 616 non-Ultimate cannon and throwing pre-carnage Gwen in there? One gwen has blue eyes, a sign of cloned carnage Gwen, while the White Widow Gwen has hazel eyes, like the pre cloned one... hope some od the hardcore lore nerds can help me understand lolï»¿"

Why does he need a web shooter if the spider gave him radio-active powers? I've always been confused about that. Maybe all the spider gave him was the ability to climb walls? Just something to think about for those Marvel nerds (no offense.)ï»¿
"Carson Doak it is pretty well known fact, that aside generic powers like â€œsuper strengthâ€ù and â€œfaster regenerationâ€ù, the spider bite gave him ability to stick to things and spider sense. If he were to research on his own powers, he would have developed an ability to discharge electricity( to stun enemies).  Many of his alternative versions have same issues and have to use web shooters. Some donâ€™t, though.ï»¿"

"So there's Miles Morales, old Peter Parker, Gwen Stacy, Detective Spider Man, Anime Girl Spider Man and Spider Ham? How many Spider Mans are there?!ï»¿"
"Jayton S. Multiverse has thousands of versions of heroes and villains, MCU and PS4 Spider men included. We do not know however if these characters are in the same multiverse , or are just merely adaptations, because they are all based of certain characters from comics ( Main Peter Parker, Ultimate Miles Morales, Peni Parker, Peter from Noir universe etc.) yet they are different.ï»¿"
+AluTheHungryGhost You're right. Maybe there are even more Spider men and women in the film?ï»¿
"Jayton S. Well they might reference some of them. You can clearly see PS4 Spider Man in the background for example( none of other Spider Men wore that suit). However I highly doubt that they will show more Spider related characters. There is a reason why these particular Spider people were chosen : Peter is based on the original Peter Parker( who is in his 30s in comics now), and takes the classic â€œmentorâ€ù role, teaching new generation of heroes( and being an example to the kids). Miles is there so the kids can associate themselves with someone: he is young, inexperienced, yet brave funny and cool looking - he is the new generation. Then there is Spider Woman( she also goes by the name Ghost Spider) - Gwen, which is again a latest addition to the female spider cast. They could have used any of their Spider Women/Girls, but they used Gwen, because she is young, smart  and  popular now. Girls can look up to her. Then there is Spider Man Noir, who is â€œrough and gruffâ€ù type of guy. Then there is anime girl- Peni Parker. She actually doesnâ€™t behave like that or remotely look like that in the comics, but since anime is hip and cool and cute, they changed her and added for those anime-lovers. Spider- Ham as obviously there as a main joke character.Now when you start thinking who else could be there, then Spider-Man 2099 doesnâ€™t make the cut because he is too edgy for the kids movie, all other female spider characters would make Gwen pointless, and having Scarlet Spiders in the movie without proper introduction would be plain stupid.Unless they will show one bad spider-man( there are ones that went rogue ad even became villains) itâ€™s unlikely for other spider heroes to appear.ï»¿"
"I'd excited but I'm starting to worry that there is going to be too much happening in this movie. We not only have Kingpin and Scorpion as villains but we also have the prowler and then the movie needs to give screen time to Peter, Gwen, Spider-ham, Spider-man noir, and Peni Parker on top of Miles Morales. I really hope this works but I'm worried that sony's ambitions might be a little too big.ï»¿"
"galactic85 I think prowler will be in only one fight, while Scorpion and Tombstone will simply be Kingpinâ€™s henchmenï»¿"

Janine Murdock are you actually slow?ï»¿
"@UniqueNameGuy 1. The article I followed that linked to this trailer initially called it ""groundbreaking"".  2. I know it's a deliberate choice, that doesn't make it good by default.  To me, it's distracting as hell. I had the same issue with Dragon Prince on Netflix. 3. What I've seen looks like a fun story with interesting characters, and so I'll be watching it regardless.  Calling the animation ""amazing"" is a stretch, though.ï»¿"

"@Janine Murdock The framerate has nothing to do with the animation though, aside from lending itself to the comic book aesthetic, so i would call the animation amazing.ï»¿"
"@UniqueNameGuy I think it has a good look.  I like the character design.  But the actual literal definition of animation is using a series of pictures to create the illusion of movement. And , at least to my mind, if that ""movement"" is noticeably jerky to where I think I might almost be back on dial-up and it just isn't buffering properly, that's... not good animation. Whether they did it purposely or no.  Pixar movies look amazing, but I don't need them to drop the framerate to cruddy levels to remind me the romance sci fi between the trash compacting robot and the Apple iRobot 20 is a fiction.They want to try something new, good for them. It's not working for me and I wish they weren't. But, c'est la vie.ï»¿"
"@Janine Murdock Â Janine MurdockÂ  The animation has less frames per second than a normal film might but it is (obviously) still animated. By the definition you just quoted, how do we define good animation? Is it the amount of individual images over a set amount of time? Is it how coherently one image moves into the next? Taken with its literal definition animation can be hard to judge. I guess it all comes down to whether you are a fan of the styleï»¿"

"So I may be stupid, but isn't Peter suppose to only be like two years older than Miles? Yet he looks 26 or so. Yes I know Miles is in another universe and stuff, though there is this animated series where Peter goes to different dimensions. In one of them he meets miles who is sitting in front of Peter Parker's, grave who died in his universe. In the animated series Peter is only a few years older, cause when miles meets him Peter tries to tell him he's not ready or something, in which Miles replies something along the lines of ""Really, your no older than me."" Or something. It's not word for word, but he does hint that Peter is only a few years older cause he was 13. Even in the series Peter from the different universe [time frame] looks to be 15-16. Though when I saw this trailer watching Venom it showed Peter coming from the other universe and miles sitting in front of his Peter's grave. Though in the movie trailer Peter looks older- like adult older. I may be stupid but it's really confusing me, cause the movie reminds me of a part dedicated in the animated series where Peter goes to different universes and Meets, Miles, the girl version of him, a spider-Ham and so on. So the movie reminded me of that. Though again, he looked younger in it, but for some reason he's older here. It's kind of messing with my brain XD  Cause I kind of wished they would have followed that and made Peter a few years older like in the series. Since I was used to it and it seems odd to make him have a stubble and look older. Like Gwen looks normal age, so you'd think Peter would look young like her too. o.Oï»¿"
"Skill I believe you are talking about the â€œUltimate Spider Manâ€ù cartoon events? If yes, that cartoon changed a lot of things from the comics.This animated film is based on 2 comic arcs : Spider-Men and Spider-Verse.The first one is about Peter fromMain universe coming to Ultimate Universe where Miles lives. They get along and defeat Mysterio from both worlds.The second story is about Spider heroes from whole multiverse getting together in order to fight Inheritors - evil family who feeds on their life energies.Now with that in mind, Peter from main universe is currently in his 30s. He was around 28-29 in â€œSpider-Menâ€ù. Miles now is around 16, I believe? He was 14 back then.ï»¿"

"Sergio Cruz people want to see these characters more and more. There are other characters, in fact they are being created every year, but people are not interested in them, preferring the good old ones.ï»¿"
"If you read the comics instead of watching the trailers of movies meant to appeal to the highest common denominator and complaining about not seeing new things, you'd know that there are tons of new superheroes with new origins and villains that are really cool. Take the time to do your research before you call out a company for unoriginlity.ï»¿"
UniqueNameGuy new superheroes? Where are they? Are you talking about any of the past 3 Spider-Manâ€™s? Plus I wouldnâ€™t call reading comics â€œresearchâ€ù.ï»¿
@Sergio Cruz Reading the source material is research on the origins of the characters. The new superheroes are in the comics like i said. You can't only watch Sony and MCU films and expect them to throw in some of their least recognisable characters as opposed to hugely iconic characters like Spider-Man. Did you expect the movies to introduce wild new concepts that have never been tried in the comics on an audience of fickle fans (most of whom have never read a comic in their lives) who may or may not react in a negative way resulting in losses for the company? Of course not! They stick with what has been shown to work from the comics. I'd also like to raise a point that only two of the five characters in the trailer got their powers from radioactive spider bites.ï»¿

Marvel is just copying dc. It just like the flash multi-verseï»¿
"In a way, Spider-Man's role within the Marvel multiverse is very similar to The Flash's role in the DC multiverse, but they're still very different. While speedsters serve as the conduit of the interdimensional Speed Force that surrounds the universes of DC, the Spider-people of Marvel are the avatars of the Cosmic Weaver who governs all the timelines of Marvel.ï»¿"
"Eh, multiverses existed in both mediums since 60s. Itâ€™s not as much copying of idea as it is a natural progression when you have a never ending story that has to be all connected. Having alternative realities gives authors freedom to make up stories that would never make sense in main world.For example, look at MCU. Making it same universe as 616 wouldnâ€™t make sense because 1) it would require people to actually read 50 years of comic books. By this alone Disney would scare away 80% of their audience 2) it wouldnâ€™t make sense at all. Peter Parker canâ€™t be 15 yr old kid now and fan of Tony Stark because he is already in his 30s in main story. Not only that but his character was always independent, especially from Avengers(until he finally joined them). Sam Jackson wouldnâ€™t play Nick Fury, because in original story he is white James Bond type war vet.  Same goes with cartoons, games and all other media these companies are represented in.ï»¿"
Multiverses have existed before flash or spiderman..ï»¿

TheBlademaster1337 but he has web shootersï»¿
"@szeax Maybe it is a kind of enhancer. In Spiderman 2 we could see that his powers stopped to work when he became depressed.Maybe old age makes him produce less web and as a backup he creates the web shooters. Or it is physically exhausting to produce organic web so he creates a shooter that let's him save energy for crime fighting?ï»¿"
"Good evidence, but yâ€™all are kind of over thinking the references at the beginning of the trailer.ï»¿"
@TheBlademaster1337 it not toby. There a thing called references you're over thinking itï»¿

"You know, if they made this into a game where you could play as all 6 spider-people, I would happily buy it. Each spider-person already has their own unique style and gameplay ""set up"" for them. Regular Peter Parker could have a bit of slower combat speed because he's slowing down in his later years, but could be a better strategist since he has more experience as Spiderman.Miles could be a bit more inexperienced but doesn't need to react too fast due to his electric shock gloves as his unique gameplay feature.Spider-Gwen, I think you could be the one with the most classic spiderman experience but you could give her a unique feature as well.Noir is pretty self-explanatory. He can be like how he was in Shattered Dimensions and work mainly from the shadows but can also do hand to hand combat if the time calls for it.SP//DR (Peni) would pilot the suit or can be by herself on occasion. With the suit she would probably have the most power and strength out of everone, especially since there's no symbiote suit, but with less durability and agility. Spider-Ham can just have changes in gameplay due to size. Really other than that, it's fun to just become Spider-Ham and beat people._Ÿ˜‚ï»¿"

"I hope it is a more mature spider man movie because of its animation style, it looks like a cartoon, which usually has some bad story and characters.The trailer was pretty nice, the characters seem to be likeable, and no trace of social justice warriors making the characters look bad. The soundtrack was cool, swae lee and post malone did a great job about saving what you love most.The whole aesthetic of the movie looks cartoonish while still making it life-like (no weird shapes or noses). The colors made it a vibrant looking film, NY was looking beatiful at night or day in the movie.I would be looking too see this movie on christmas. Recent spiderman movies were great, homecoming was pretty solid. This movie looks like its aimed to a more younger audience but still can be watched by adults. I just hope that it came out great, marvel is doing such a great job with spider man right now, its a shame if they messed up with this.ï»¿"

"Yes, Nicolas Cage voices Spider-Noir in Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse and I actually think that his voice may fit, too bad that in the trailer we get to hear only one sentence from him ""Hey fellas"".ï»¿"

Rasta Goobers Maybe actually learn about the source material instead of spouting out racist nonsense.ï»¿
How many origin stories is spider man going to have? Im over spider man seriously can we invest in the other super heros there are so many more that don't get credit. While this is like the tenth spider man movie and honestly its something I will never watch.ï»¿
"King Yellow Wolf it's the 7th, and this is a different story and a different characterï»¿"
szeax 7 dosent seem like an excessive amount of films about the same thing? And only 3 of those 7 had the same character. Also 3 of those 7 movies were all origin stories. We don't need another one about spider man I'd like to see something different not another spin off movie that's based on the same thing. Seriously as fans of comics and super hero's I think we owe it to ourselves to criticize this. How many people are we going to make rich because they keep giving us the same thing just copy and paste. I love Spider-Man but am I tired of seeing him be the only super hero that gets a re boot every couple years absolutely.ï»¿
King Yellow Wolf none of them were about the same thing... but okï»¿
szeax Your joking right? 3 movies are all about how peter parkers grandfather gets murdered and he becomes the spider man. Have you seen any of them?ï»¿
"King Yellow Wolf you mean uncle, right? And still, only ONE of them focuses on uncle ben, that is the first one.ï»¿"
szeax yeah his uncle lol uncle ben. And there's been 3 they all have a different actor as spider man but all tell the same story. And how the hell can Gwen Stacy still be around? And be in school still? And be that young? When peter Parker is old? This makes no sense and just throws all the canon out of the window. Is this really what you want as a spider man fan? I sure as hell don't.ï»¿
"King Yellow Wolf all of your questions just mean that you never  actually read canon stories. Marvel has Multiverse, established since 70s. This film adapts various characters from that multiverse.1) The â€œOldâ€ù Peter is based on main/original( Earth- 616) Peter Parker, yes, the one from â€œAmazing Spider-Manâ€ù series, that started in 60s and continue to this day.  Main Peter has became Spider Man when he was 15, but as story went, he aged. He is in his 30s currently.2) the black kid is Miles Morales. He is based on Miles Morales from Ultimate Universe. In â€œUltimate Spider Manâ€ù, Peter was the first Spider Man, but he died at age 16-17 while fighting Green Goblin. Miles took the mantle and continued his legacy.3) Gwen is based on Gwen Stacy from Earth-65. In that world, she was bitten by spider instead of Peter. Peter becomes Lizard and dies. She is a high schooler because  her universe doesnâ€™t follow same timeline as main universe.4) dude in black costume is Peter Parker from Noir universe.  In this world he lived during 1930s and became Spider Man because of ancient artifact.5) Spider Ham is comedic character from animal universe. Pretty much everyone there is an animal. He also one of the first alternative universe characters, appearing in 1973.6)  Peni Parker is based on Peni Parker from Earth-14152. While being one of the new additions to the multiverse, she is quite popular. The character doesnâ€™t have spider powers, but relies on exosuit. In the film they made her  cute ( as well as her robot) in order to appeal the kids.So if you ask me, a spider man fan, they didnâ€™t throw the canon out of the window at all. In fact, they are quite following it.ï»¿"

we will eat that pig....ï»¿
i like how john mulaney is in this as well-ï»¿
"to me, the concept behind the multiple universe thing doesn't make sense, due to peter Parker and the line miles says ""I'm the one and only spider man"" and ""that's  impossible"". Its like they were going to originally only have miles, but the executives were like, oh there aren't enough big names and white people in here so gotta add these new characters""ï»¿"
willly phie I think you're just..  braindeadï»¿

Miles Moralesï»¿
"WTF?!why is spiderman black?!!!!!?ï»¿"
"pouya ghahremanzade because Miles Morales is black. He was born in black Latino family. He never was white. Why did he become Spider Man? Because he was bitten just like Peter Parker. Does he have same powers? No, he doesnâ€™t.Is he â€œblack Peter Parkerâ€ù?No he is not, Peter and him are 2 different people.Why does something like this exist?Because multiverse exists. Multiverse allows authors to explore different situations without ruining main storyline. For example â€œ what if Peter Parker lived in 30s and his family was killed by mafia?â€ù Here you go, Spider Man Noir. â€œWhat if Peter was not a super genius he is and relied on Tony Starkâ€™s guidance and technology?â€ù Here you go, MCU Spider Man:Homecoming. In this case,  itâ€™s â€œ what if Peter Parker died young, and someone else continued his legacyâ€ù.ï»¿"
"i get that ma manbut we always saw peter and he was white& i'd be shocked if i saw a mexican black pantherï»¿"

JazRo Art I was here from day one.ï»¿
"I want this movie to be good. I love Miles, and the plot seems interesting. But the animation just looks so unappealing. Like it was rendered at 12 fpsï»¿"
The Not So Funny Show Actually saw an exclusive clip when I went to see Venom and the animation seems fine. And I think itâ€™s not 60fps because itâ€™s more comic book themedï»¿
"@JazRo Art it can be ""comic book themed"" without looking like a cell phone game from a Nokia. Also, since comic books don't have frames per second, the whole comic book style thing doesn't make senseï»¿"
The Not So Funny Show Bro the animation is beautiful tf you talkin aboutï»¿
@JazRo Art I'm not talking about the art style. That looks fine. I'm talking about the animationï»¿
"The Not So Funny Show What about the animation? I said it looks beautiful. And the frames arenâ€™t bad, Iâ€™ve seen a movie clip from Venom and it looks fineï»¿"
"@JazRo Art ...did you not read what I said before? Your seeing a clip from venom is irrelevant; we all see clips from the movie in the two trailers currently available. The animation is choppy, unappealing, and just plain difficult to watch. It's as if the animation studio tried to make it look like a stop motion movie, but since it's CG animated, it looks like it was made like that to cut corners so they can release it faster.ï»¿"
"The Not So Funny Show How is the clip from venom irrelevant, if the clip is literally a clip of Into The Spiderverse? Dude are you stupid?ï»¿"
"@JazRo Art if you can't see that a clip from this movie is irrelevant due to the fact we have two different trailers showing clips from the same movie, and you think it is somehow different. Then I'm sorry, but it appears you suffer from an extreme case of stupidity.ï»¿"

"Joe S nah. When he met er, it was pretty cool between them. Maybe partially because she s still a schoolgirl, whereas he is already 30 years old dude, for whom Gwen died ages ago.There is howeve, Peter, who went insane because of Gwenâ€™s death. He became new Goblin.ï»¿"

â€œAye man spider man should be blackâ€ù Logic called it.ï»¿
Jakeeym he was black years before he said thatï»¿
I'm hoping to see this.ï»¿
It seems like it would be cool but that choppy frame rate is killing me. It's all I can see and it's real bad.ï»¿

Matheus Cruz howï»¿
Whatâ€™s the song of the trailer?ï»¿
2:33 i just got a new idea to drawï»¿
"Well...We got Homecoming, Venom and This.HECK.YE.ï»¿"
1:37 Now Iâ€™m no marvel expert anime has always been my strong suit but Iâ€™m pretty sure thatâ€™s not a spiderman character....period unless it is and people just donâ€™t like to talk about itï»¿
ThatGuy YesThatguy Penny Parker is pretty popular actuallyï»¿
aesthetic gamecube seriously wow whereâ€™d she even come from thoughï»¿
"ThatGuy YesThatguy she was introduced several years ago in â€œEdge of Spider-Verseâ€ù. She is however, quite different in comic books. Her mech is different( looking more like evangelion), and sheâ€™s rather serious kid( whose parents are dead). They made her an anime airhead for the kids obviously.ï»¿"
Phil Lord and Christopher Miller should direct an animation of The Walking Dead with similar visual style like this. But The Walking Dead must feature Clementine from TWD.ï»¿
No please no walking dead I want them to make stop motion and 3d and turn it into laggy bloodï»¿
So at 1:49 isnâ€™t that miles uncle? The one whoâ€™s the villain thatâ€™s running across the wall with those special boots at 1:53?The same guy in homecoming when spider was interrogating him?ï»¿
"Yep, Aaron Davis, aka The Prowler.ï»¿"
Wait..isnâ€™t he dead? Why are you making a spin-off series if his death was final?ï»¿
Amber-Lei Curtis You realize that Peter gets revived in part 2ï»¿
Amber-Lei Curtis This is a completely different universe. It isn't connected to the MCU at all.ï»¿
"This is not part of the MCU.Is completely made by Sony.ï»¿"
aesthetic gamecube there isnâ€™t going to be a part 2. Marvel confirmed that all deaths in infinity war are final. They arenâ€™t coming back.ï»¿
"@Amber-Lei Curtis Avengers 4 is the second part.Heck they're even filming Far From Home that will start right after Avengers 4 ending.ï»¿"
Lqqï»¿
"I got significantly less excited each time they introduced a new spider, and by spider pig I was like â€œcmon, seriously?â€ù The movie would be better if it was just UC Spider-Man, classic Spider-Man, and maybe Spider-Gwen.ï»¿"
Its not a spiderverse movie without spider ham and noirï»¿
Basically the black spider man and a feminist girl and the bad guy is a rich white guy anything wrong with thatï»¿
"No, because this is the same movie that has an Anime girl, a retro superhero, and a pig working alongside Peter Parker.ï»¿"
"2:29Doesn't that way he stands looks like Black Panther?ï»¿"
"1:40Look at the background and I see pictures of Spider Man villans like Mr Negativeï»¿"

Peter Parker is the only Spider-Man. Everything else is just a rip off or copy cat because some people can't invent their own superheroes. They have to steal from others.ï»¿
Ok? You do know this is a different universe in where peter dies and miles has to take the mantle as Spider-Man.ï»¿
"spirittammyk Correction, not steal from others but from themselves.ï»¿"
"No, it's just Marvel caving into the SJW's. Instead of making a completely new character with a completely new set of skills, they have to just hijack an already beloved white male character and change them to a female or non white male. It's all it is. And the whole of Spider-Man is that PETER PARKER GETS BIT BY A RADIOACTIVE SPIDER AND HAS HIS DNA ALTERED BECAUSE OF IT. You can't just give someone else the mantle when it was Peter Parker who was bit and no one else. Get it? Just how you can appoint someone else to be Storm or Wolverine or Rogue. Anyone else is just a copy cat to appease to the SJW's who are just too stupid to create their own characters, so have to lash out at white man to do the creative thinking for them. -!-ï»¿"
"FN Danmark, I stand by my statement. SJW's used affirmative action to force Marvel to hire them, and they were hired. And when they were at the drawing board, instead of creating a new character, they decided to just take a white male character and change him into a non white character. Same thing they are doing to Iron-Man. The only time I can let this slide is when Steve Rogers gives his mantle over to one of his soldiers (I personally hope in case of the MCU, it is Sam Wilson and not Bucky)  This is why people love Black Panther. He is legit and an original. He's not taking the mantle from someone else.ï»¿"
This.... looks so GOOD!!ï»¿

Dimensional portals and time travel are 2 different things.ï»¿
"Lobster Wings Is Sauceless it isnâ€™t though. In comic multiverse traveling to another time is just like traveling to another universe. Hence why â€œMarvel 2099â€ù had designation Earth-928( for Timestorm Spider Man 2099 it was earth 96099 and for current Spider Man 2099 the number is yet to be established) ,  and MC2 universe had the designation Earth -982. whereas main â€œModern Timesâ€ù universe had designation Earth 616. As it was explained in â€œUltimates 2â€ù, different times and possibilities are basically worlds that ride along same thread and get closer to each other if actions of character cause the most likely outcome for that â€œfutureâ€ù.ï»¿"
oh okayï»¿
The Survivor 117 spiderman 2099 may still be in this movie but they just didn't show him in the trailer because they don't want to spoil everything in the movieï»¿
The Survivor 117 plus if you're making a crossover wouldn't make sense to put one of your more obscure characters to help make them more popular?ï»¿
Yes and that's a good thing.ï»¿
"You bring up 2099, but then call Peni obscure? Yeaaah... You, sir or madam, know nothing about comics and related media. Both characters are equally both beloved AND obscure. I should know...I work in the industry every day. But donâ€™t worry...Iâ€™m sure we will  get our 2099 in some form or another.ï»¿"

"@Null and Void ""Slaps!"" Lenguage!ï»¿"
"@masamune2984 ""Equally beloved"" 60% things related to her in the comments were people asked who she is. The rest are mostly jokes. She got to comic book issues in Edge of the Spider-Geddon and Edge of the Spider-verse. 2 comics that sold just okay,because there was the title of the event of the front. 2099 is after Miles and Peter the most well known Spider-Man,he has his own comic series,makes in many Spider-man comics appearances and is in every big Spider-man event with Dimensions travel related things. Peni Parker can't even get a good adaptation,because it wouldn't make as much money as if she was in her comics. She is by far not equally beloved if only people know she since 2014 in a one shot....ï»¿"
"Spider-Verse literally had about 50 Spider-Men, Spider-Women, Spider-Girls, a Spider-Monkey, a Spider-Pig, and I'm pretty sure there was a Spider-Cat in there as well, fighting a family of dimension hopping Spider Vampires, actually wait a second why did they change it to a collider rather then the whole Spider Vampire thing that would've been beyond epicï»¿"

"c20995 I barely noticed because in other scenes( and in other trailer) he isnâ€™t shown to have any. I guess itâ€™s just stylistic choice to show his movement like this.

"Depends on universe and medium. Original Peter is in range of 60-80 tons( could be more). He can hold a skyscraper on his shoulders. He also always pulls his punches, because if he didnâ€™t , he would rip peopleâ€™s heads off. Ultimate Peter Parker was in 15 Ton range( although he was still young). In movies all Spider Men are nerfed ( just like any superhero there is). Raimiâ€™s Peter is probably the weakest , then goes Garfield and Holland.ï»¿"

"Peni Parker is not very well known and could have been replaced by Spiderman 2099 or the Scarlet Spider, but I am entirely ok with this (has absolutely nothing to do with my inner weeb) and I understand why they did it as it allows them to draw a character in a drastically different animation style (like how Spider Ham is animated like loony toons and Spiderman Noir is animated like a 80's dectective movie with printer dots making up his color) which is of-course some of the more mainstream anime styles.ï»¿"

Non Denominational? What do you mean?ï»¿
"At first I thought that the ""non-denominational holiday"" song was a good joke about the PC stuff surrounding holidays.But it's actually really clever because it also hides Spidey's identity; you don't know what holiday he celebrates because that would narrow down the list of people that could be Spider-Man.ï»¿"
@Vegetarian Soylent-Green WOW! That  is probably the most cleverly thought out comment I've ever read on YouTube.ï»¿

"A Non-denominational holiday wishes song for 25th December, 2019.It's that time of year, When the snow falls, when the snow falls, when the snow falls.And right across the city,It all looks so clean and pretty.Because from wall to wall the snow falls, the snow falls.And the soft sound padding it makes,And the time of year peace it creates,Makes our hearts appreciate that winter time is the best time,When time seems slow and steady,And as you dream in a nice warm bed cuddled up by your teddy. There's just such a good morning ahead, because as you slept in the night, there will have been  a little present mysteriously magically placed there for you. And all the special day your happiness will shine through.For the present is Spider Man and he looks just like you. Peace for the cold season and you! But no one in the whole wide world should be upset if they don't get what they want, because as long as they've got love and warmth with them on that Special Day, no amount of presents can take such gifts of life away. That's why we celebrate The 25th of December day - So HOORAY! for the wonderful Holiday!  HOORAY, HOORAY, HOORAY.ï»¿"

Where's 2099. He's like the most iconic alternate version of spiderman?ï»¿
The Fursecutioner 779 he really isn't. He's less popular than noirï»¿
Scarlett...ï»¿
"The Fursecutioner 779 I can name like three people who are more known than him. Definitely not the most iconic Spider-Man, but it would have been cool to see him in this movieï»¿"
"The Fursecutioner 779 Miles, Spider Gwen, and Noir are more popular than him currently.ï»¿"
Peni Parker is probably the least known one with Spider Noir being extremely popular as-well as Miles and Gwen (people also like Spider Ham just for the memes though)ï»¿
"I'd say Miles and Spider-Gwen supplanted him as the most popular alternate versions. If Noir had been more popular than 2099, then Noir would've had a spin-off game dedicated to him, whereas 2099 did. It's probably just harder to tie in 2099 since he's technically not ""alternate"", so much as a possible future.ï»¿"
The Fursecutioner 779 I'm thinking maybe he is in the movie along with some other spider men and women but they probably just didn't show him in the trailer because they don't want to spoil everything this movie has to offerï»¿
The Fursecutioner 779 all too trueï»¿
"2099 is really cool but D-tier at best, at least compared to the likes of Miles, Gwen, Noir, etc. I enjoy his character though, even if he IS just Batman Beyond wearing a Spider-Man suit: Iâ€™m sure weâ€™ll get him in some kind of form, even if just a reference l.ï»¿"
B I T C H    L A S  A G N Aï»¿
If Spider-man 2099 isn't in the movie then I'll kill Peni Parker or Spider-ham for taken time away where Spider-man 2099 could have been.                                                                                                                     (I'm not saying they are bad characters btw infact Peni Parker is in my top 10 Spider-man /woman list)ï»¿
"Scarlet Spidey so why kill them? Why not kill, I don't know, a villain that takes up time?ï»¿"
"@szeax Don't take things so literally,I mean I would be disappointed,because he needs to have at least 1 big screen adaptation since he's the 3rd most popular Spidey. It would be also hard to kill a comic book character since they don't really exists.ï»¿"
"Scarlet Spidey he's less popular than spider gwen, noir, miles, etc. he isn't the third most popularï»¿"
"@szeax He is after Peter and Miles the most popular. Check his sales they are way above Spider-Gwen and noir, Spider-Gwen exists since 2014 and Spider-man 2099 since 1992,she just gets more represented in cartoons . Noir is also not as popular for the same reasons,I mean he doesn't even gets more represented than him in media. Spider-Gwen could get more popular in the future since she gets her own series and she gets more and more comics that involve her. The only one that comes ""close"" to the popularity of Spider-man 2099 is Ben Reilly,but he has much less comics and it seems Spider-Gwen will take his 4th place when her series comes out, but it will take it's time to beat 2099 in terms of popularity.ï»¿"

"@AluTheHungryGhost If I remember correctly the Skin Cancer Peter was not canon the the Marvel comics,it was a different series,with more realistic outcomes,right?ï»¿"

Supaidaman aka Japanese Spiderman drove a mech called Leopardon. It even got a cameo in the comics.ï»¿
"The original design for Peni Parker IS an Evangelion homage, down to the mech she pilots. The movie distances itself from those references to better suit the variety of the cast.

Great...now I know the plot of the movie...ï»¿
Yeah thats what trailers are for....ï»¿
@SD Brand yeah but good trailers can create hype and yet leave the mystery of the story for the movieï»¿
Tidely Pom so what's the plot?ï»¿
"@szeax let's see if I can create a general outline. In the universe of miles, he's just gone through the process of being bitten and uncovering his powers. somewhere down the line, miles path intertwines with kingpins plans involving a collider that opens up a gateway to different universes unwillingly drawing in all the spiders from the different universes that happened to be in the exact same locations. After that, somewhere between Parker mentoring miles and mile's dad disliking spider Man, we get to know that the gateway is still functioning in a way that it's causing their universe to rip apart. This may be similar to the concept of phase shifting in ant man and the wasp. I'm lrobably wrong here tho. All the spiders need to come together to try and fix the situation and defeat the boss( maybe kingpin) and return to their universe. Off course, in between the plots going to take us through humourous situations like a typical spiderman comicbook arc and character development of his dad and mile's himself. Now we have to wait for other trailers to fill in missing details like are there more villains and stuff.ï»¿"
The graphics sucksï»¿
Not really. The graphics look great. It's like reading a comic bookï»¿

Why is spider man black ?ï»¿
"chaz Hill because Miles Morales is black-Latino. He became second Spider Man in his world, after his Peter Parker died.ï»¿"
*GOOSEBUMPS*ï»¿

Yuckï»¿
"Does peni parker have abilities like a normal spiderman? Wall crawling, spider sense, web shooting and stuff like that?ï»¿"
She does not. Hence why she rides a robot.ï»¿
also none of them shoot webs lmaoï»¿
"@szeax wdym? Peter shoot webs,(i don't know if others share this abilities or not) just watch spiderman 3. The first fight scene between peter and harry, he shoot multiple short web to harry but misses. And on some spiderman games (i forgot it's name) there is a skill called web shooter where spidey shoot multiple short web bullet like to his enemies.ï»¿"
"IFI PLAY The first three spiderman movies aren't canon. Peter can't shoot webs.ï»¿"
This was a disappointing surprise after Venom creditsï»¿
whyï»¿
@szeax this has nothing to do with Venomï»¿
I LOVE how spiderman noir looksï»¿

If they are trying to emulate claymation I don't know if they're doing a decent job, since I've seen stop motion animation with smoother, more natural feeling movement.

"I really hope this movie does well. I really hope this movie doesnâ€™t suck. SONY has had a HUGE reputation of making shitty movies: Emoji Movie, The last 2 Hotel Transylvaniaâ€™s, Adam Sandler movies, and...well, Venom was mediocre. This movie has so much potential of being good. This movie can make SONY redeem themselves. When the first 2 Into the Spider-Verse trailers came out, they were beautiful, stylish and, they captured the beautiful scenery and visual style of the comics and the animation was gorgeous, plusC it could be in ways like Black Panther since the superhero is biracial. And kids will look up to Miles. But, seeing the after credits scene of Venom with this, right after the sneak peek of this showed, everyone was so disappointed because the clip was so childish and stupid...and I really hope this movie doesnâ€™t suck.ï»¿"

"The movie itself looks fun to watch.  However, why is Hollywood trying to make every character either black or female ?  Thereâ€™s talk about a black James Bond, a black Superman.  We now have the female Ghost Busters and the female Terminator.  Instead of creating original characters or promoting those that are already black and/or female, Hollywood is just changing famous, fictional personas.  If you want REAL racial/gender equality just create something unique instead of stealing and altering the work of others.ï»¿"
"H G Iâ€™m surprised you havenâ€™t come across the thousands of comments that say this but it isnâ€™t a black Spider-Man, Miles is from the comics well before all this modern day crapï»¿"
"Miles Morales was created in 2011, perhaps as a response to the Donald GLover for Spider-man campaignï»¿"
"This has been going on for a while.  Itâ€™s not recent at all.  We can talk about DC and how they changed the sexual orientation, gender and skin color of quite a few characters.ï»¿"
"Also, add the fact that Peter Parker is the original Spider-Man and then a knockoff was created to seem more inclusive.  I rather have Marvel, along with D.C, to promote characters that were originally black, female or have â€œnon-normativeâ€ù sexual orientation.ï»¿"
"Weird that youâ€™re willing to accept a Spider-Man that is also a literal pig no questions asked, but a black Spider-Man is just a bridge too far.ï»¿"
d3lvn At least he isnâ€™t a knockoff.  All Iâ€™m saying is that itâ€™s tiring to see characters changed just to conform to a P.C culture.ï»¿
"â€œAt least he isnâ€™t a knock-offâ€ùlol what? Theyâ€™re both derivatives of the same character! The pig is no more or less a knock-off than Miles is. Iâ€™m just saying itâ€™s strange that you donâ€™t think Spider-Ham infringes upon the integrity of Spider-Man, but the black guy does. Deeply strange set of priorities you got there.ï»¿"
"d3lvn When a version of a character has been completely altered there is an issue.  Of course I, like most others, have a problem with a black version of Spider-Man.  Imagine if Hollywood decided to make a white or Mexican version of Black Panther.  Itâ€™s not just color I have a problem with but rather any radical changes to a character wether it be appearance or mannerisms.  Especially when itâ€™s to conform to PC culture.ï»¿"
"@H G ""When a version of a character has been completely altered there is an issue.""""Itâ€™s not just color I have a problem with but rather any radical changes to a character wether it be appearance or mannerisms.""Oh, you mean like Spider-Ham?ï»¿"
d3lvn Spider-Ham ?  You do know most people donâ€™t even know who that is right ?ï»¿
H G I highly doubt most people watching this video donâ€™t have at least a vague sense of who that is considering heâ€™s in the trailer.ï»¿
d3lvn ...or people just learned about him due to watching the trailer.ï»¿
"Black Panther is an AFRICAN king, Spider-man is a poor kid from New York, there's a difference,and besides most kids in New York from low income families aren't white these days, it just reflects the existing realities. In any case there's no reason to be whining about it.ï»¿"
"Ty K. Spider-Man (Peter Parker) is a poor WHITE kid from NY.  People get pissed off of a â€œcoloredâ€ù character was â€œwhite-washedâ€ù.  So why is â€œblack-washingâ€ù O.K !  Using your logic, Cyborg from D.C was created by his father who is a scientist.  The majority are white, Asian or Jewish.  So, maybe Cyborg shouldnâ€™t be black to reflect reality.  Now itâ€™s funny how my comment to skin color is what bothered you but not my comment about sexual orientation or gender.  All Iâ€™m saying is that Hollywood â€œIN GENERALâ€ù has been making drastic changes to successful characters to comply with the P.C narrative.  Instead they should use characters that are originally Black, gay, women or whatever.ï»¿"
"Except Miles is separate character created in the 21st century, he's not Peter anyways. Having someone else take up the mantle of a hero isn't something new.  If Sony is going to milk this franchise they are going to include the other characters, especially ones that have proven to be POPULAR. I don't think changing a characters ethnicity is something they ought to do in general, but it is not something I'm going to cry over either. To answer your question, White characters are usually characterized mostly by their personality, not the fact that their white, while for POC characters their status as a minority or their heritage is far more likely to play a significant role in their story, so whitewashing messes up the character itself. Additionally whitewashing reduces the already limited number of roles given to POC actors while there are still countless acting roles for white people.ï»¿"
"Ty K. Dude, you just stated that the charactersâ€™ ethnicity plays a big role as a minority.  Thatâ€™s the problem right there.  Itâ€™s less about the character and more about their skin color.  You also just stated that itâ€™s to help POCs get more roles.  PC culture is getting out of control.  This is not the only movie or character I mentioned BTW.  However, you, like a lot of other people, only care about the charactersâ€™ appearance.  Since â€œWhite characters are usually characterized by their personality,â€ù then we should have more white characters at this point.  I care more about the content but itâ€™s being sacrificed for the superficial and to push an agenda.ï»¿"
"Its less about pushing diversity and more about trying to adapt to a more diverse market. Comics are less exclusively a white teen thing these days so they're trying to draw in more, newer groups of readers. Its not about the politics, its about the money.ï»¿"
"JLT0087 Thatâ€™s not 100% true.  There have been video games, comics and movies that did terribly even though they were promoting â€œdiversityâ€ù.  Also, comic businesses that were pushing a Liberal agenda had to shut down.  Now some businesses are trying to reach a more diverse group but in turn are sacrificing quality.  Their mentality is â€œIf we just have a diverse cast the money will flow.  Screw putting actual effort into our media.â€ù  Not only that, one doesnâ€™t have to be the same ethnicity or gender as a character/person to relate or idolize them.  There are many people of color, both male and female, who idolize Marilyn Monroe.  Frank Sinatra has had his songs covered by many people who were not physically like him.  Batman and Superman are adored by White and non-White people in And out of the U.S.  Itâ€™s all about content not physicality.ï»¿"
"@H G It's a bit of an oversimplification, true, but entertainment is still a buisness and will always be guided by money. You're right to say that a lot of them are treating diversity as a quick fix, and not following it up with actual effort.ï»¿"
"How does the way white characters are written necessitate more white characters? What makes you think I'm only interested in their appearance just because I defend the creative decisions of one children's movie? This movie is more about Sony milking their IP for all its worth, THAT is their agenda, you'll still get plenty of movies about Peter. You really like to jump to weird conclusions to fit YOUR agenda, stick to watching Rebel videos and don't watch this if it bothers you that much. You complain about ""pc culture"" but are part of a culture that plays the exact same whiny games about things that don't really affect you.ï»¿"
"Ty K. Again, I stated this movie and media in general.  Again, I stated that there are businesses pushing this agenda.  Again, I stated that the quality of entertainment is being sacrificed to fit this PC culture to push an agenda or make money.  If getting good quality entertainment means making all characters white, since you stated that white characters have more developed personalities then, so be it.  The fact that you care more about skin color than actual character development says more about you than anything.  Now, this character seems endearing.  However, I my argument is that original characters are being radically changed to fit a narrative or they are being replaced by someone/something more PC.  Iâ€™m talking about, not just skin color, but also gender, religion and sexual orientation.ï»¿"
"sigh Again, where did I state skin color matters more than character development? I didn't know the two things are mutually exclusive. I didn't say white characters had more developed personalities, the personality just gets more focus for white characters, that alone doesn't make them better or worse or developed per se. Sony approached Miller and Lord about doing an animated film and they picked  in Miles as their main character as Peter had already been done many times.

"We thought from the beginning that the everyday life of spider-man is fighting crime and saving his hometown of New York while other big heroes go on a big adventures.1. Avengers save earth and sometimes the galaxy.2. Guardians of the Galaxy save the galaxy.3. Fantastic Four save earth and explore the N-Zone.4. X-men save the world and deal with the mutant racism from human.But with the introduction from the first cartoon (Spider Wars Part 1: I Really, Really Hate Clones) featuring other universes of spider-men known as the spider-verse to video games (Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions) and comic books and now this movie, this spider life is never going the same any more.That is why spider-man is still the best super hero ever.Plus Peni Parker is cute and her mech SP//dr is awesome.ï»¿"

Donâ€™t know about movie but Music is Awesome!!!!!!!ï»¿
I thought this is a live action film for the next Spiderman sequal for the MCU; Why are they making an animated movie of Spiderman when we already have a live action film? And what are the directors and producers think it's okay to change Peter Parkers character. Spiderman it's not the same as the original anymore. What are they doing?ï»¿
What's wrong with using a different Spider Man?ï»¿
"1) this Peter Parker is actually more close to original one than MCU is. 2) There are quite many Spider-themed heroes besides Peter Parker. Ben Reilly and Kaine are Scarlet Spiders. Then there is Silk, Arachne and 3 Spider Women. Miles Morales( main character here) is just one of many Spider Men from parallel worlds. 3) why not?  Itâ€™s just one of many alternative worlds stories. You are not complaining about MCU being alternative to the original story, do you?ï»¿"
"Lillian Tran, this movie, Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse is made by Sony, not Marvel Entertainment, because Sony owns the film rights to spider-man, they lent the character to Marvel to use in their MCU, while Sony works on other titles that are completely unrelated to said MCU, such as Venom and this animated movie, so there's no point looking at marvel and asking them why they're doing this because they have nothing to do with it at allï»¿"
"For starters, this movie is made entirely by Sony, not alongside Marvel Studios.ï»¿"

OH MY GOD GUYS A BLACK SPIDERMAN HOW PROGRESSIVERLY PRETENTIOUS AND NOT DOWN RIGHT TRY HARD RETARDED HAHAHAHAHAHAï»¿
your comment is soooo much more try hard then this tbhï»¿
"Okay there's so much wrong with this comment that I don't even know where to begin. But I guess I'll start with the fact that ""pretentious"" refers to something that is trying too hard to seem deeper or more impactful then it is, which gives both sides of your conjunction the exact same meaning. So this doesn't make a whole lot of sense. You basically said ""A black Spider-Man, how try hard and not down right try hard"".  Second, Miles Morales has been a character in Marvel canon for years. Third, typing something in all caps is annoying and does not make your point seem any stronger. Fourth, you spelled ""progressively"" wrong.  But other then that this comment was great. 10/10 for effort.ï»¿"

When are they going to do a Chinese Spider-Man or maybe Indian or Philippino. Or is it only blacks that feel the need to cultural appropriate everything a white man does? Fk sony and fk Hollywood. Nobody is asking the NBA to have more white basketball players. And sure as fk nobody is asking any other culture on this planet accept white culture to be more â€œdiverseâ€ù. You want to stop racism stop taking about it and stop feeling guilty  about contrived leftist narratives. Give me movies that donâ€™t have stupid SJW or just die Hollywood.ï»¿
Need a tamp?ï»¿
"@I'm dat Guy yeah, that person needs one very badly.ï»¿"
"Ace FreelyOmg this is a good quality EDGY complaintï»¿"
"There is an Indian Spider-Man (Pavitr Prabhakar) since 2005 in the comics. Miles in contrast is only around since 2011. Not that this matters to you... there is a literal talking cartoon pig Spider-Man (Peter Porker, around since 1983) in this movie, but you chose to be offended by the black kid.ï»¿"
"Film literally features a black, white Asian and pig spider man but the black one is the one that offends you? You are a joke.ï»¿"
I'm dat Guy - weak. You have nothing to argue so attack my manhood. Well Nancy itâ€™s very much in tact. Funny thing about you lefties. You never know who ur talking to. Stupidity is common place. Stop playing video games and watching basketball and read a history book. Then come back and we can have a chat.ï»¿
MrAmazing79 truth has a tendency to get in your face. Embrace it.ï»¿
MrLondonuts Iâ€™m not offended at all. Iâ€™m not racist like minorities are. Im just sick of all the PC culture that at its core says that anything a white man does is racist so minority groups need to do it over with another culture. Itâ€™s actually quite pathetic.ï»¿
"Ace Freely well as I said, I find it slightly confusing and also a bit hilarious that in the film that features multiple different spider people from different dimensions, that are different races, genders, ages and even species, You only have a problem with the black one.ï»¿"
"Ace Freely Ok, firstly â€œIâ€™m not racist like minorities areâ€ù thatâ€™s racist. Secondly, what you said about your dislike towards PC culture, ok sure, you donâ€™t like that but this film isnâ€™t that. If they turned peter Parker black that would be unacceptable, but miles is not a black peter Parker, he is an iteration of Spider-Man that also happens to be black, the same way Gwen isnâ€™t a girl peter Parker but a different character and an iteration of Spider-Man, peni Parker, is not an Asian female peter Parker but a different character who is an iteration of Spider-Man. The only character weâ€™ve seen in this movie that fits the pc culture you dislike is peter porker aka spider ham, he is literally designed to be the animal version of peter Parker. So if you want to be angry at anything be angry at the pig._Ÿê·ï»¿"

"The funny thing is, if it weren't for Japanese Spiderman, Power Rangers and Super Sentai might not exist today. At least not in the way we know them.ï»¿"
"Dubu Worshipper She is anime. She's the epitome of an anime archetype, her entire thing is obviously to mean that she's the ""anime one"", in the same way that Spider-Ham is ""the cartoon one"". In this movie at least. Not so much in the original comics, but even in those her concept was heavily inspired by anime tropes, even if she didn't look anime by design.ï»¿"
"James G itâ€™s NOT anime, but merely INSPIRED by it. smhï»¿"
"Dubu Worshipper ""Anime"" is also an adjective. Something can be ""anime"" without literally being a Japanese made animation, in the same way that something can be ""cartoony"" without literally being a cartoon.ï»¿"
"-There is a Mangaverse Spiderman who is part of a spider ninja clan very Shonen Inspired-Peni Parker is also inspired Anime/Manga but Seinen series like ""Evangelion"" and ""Akira"" Peni's introduction in Edge of Spider verse included characters that look an awful lot like Rei, Asuka, Shinji & Kaneda,ï»¿"
"James G i get that, but the fact that the creator of the character of Peni, who was only influenced by manga, would not call his creation â€œanime/mangaâ€ù remains. they did stylize Peni in this film to be anime-inspired. but iâ€™m also talking about the original design/concept/comic.ï»¿"
"If you want an anime Spider-Man, check out the â€œMangaverseâ€ù line.ï»¿"
Adrian The Vulture but Super Sentai aired before the japanese Spider-Man show aired....ï»¿
AnimeFreak stfu weeabooï»¿
"Dubu Worshipper Yes, but people are talking about her variation in this movie, not the original comic concept so you're point is kinda a moot one don't you think? You acted like people were wrong for calling this version of Peni anime because the original comic Peni isn't fully anime (which is debatable. She doesn't look anime but her concept and storyline is very heavy in anime tropes). That doesn't make sense.ï»¿"
"James G So if something has anime tropes and is animated, you call it anime. i see youâ€™re the same type of person who thinks Big Hero 6 and TLA are anime. theyâ€™re INSPIRED but theyâ€™re not anime. ask someone who creates manga/anime for a living, oh wait, theyâ€™re all in Japan.ï»¿"
"Dubu Worshipper Anime is a adjective like I said. Frickin' hell, mate, get your stick outta your backside.ï»¿"
James G please give me more examples of what you consider â€œanimeâ€ù. please. I would appreciate it.ï»¿
"Dubu Worshipper Jeez Louis. Look, Peni Parker is made to be the ""anime spider-man"" in this movie. That's the bottom line. Anime is a adjective, like ""cartoony"". Seriously, get outta here. To quote you ""I bet you're one of those people who"" gets triggered when someone uses the term ""Japanese anime"" because you think that anime is strictly from Japan.  ""Anime"" can refer to an animation style. To quote wikipedia:""Outside Japan, anime refers specifically to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics, vibrant characters and fantastical themes.""Peni Parker is anime in this movie. Why is this so hard to get. Jeez, I feel like I'm trying to teach long-division to a 3 year old...ï»¿"

"â€‹@Warilized In Japanese, cartoon is referred to as Anime (AnimÄ“shon), and are classified interchangeably.Outside of Japan, most people (including localization companies like Funimation and Viz Media) refer to Japanese animation as Anime for simple/implicit reason. Some may get upset by one saying ""anime"", but my point is that what he says is totally understandable. Would you rather him say ""moe Japanese animation""? What else would he refer it as? ""They have a cartoon spider man""?ï»¿"

"Miles says heâ€™s â€œthe one and only spider man,â€ù however in the comics he became spider man after the death of Peter, meaning theyâ€™re probably taking miles somewhere completely different in terms of story, which I love cuz personally I think heâ€™s too bland in the comics and his personality is just â€œPeter Parker 2.â€ùï»¿"

"Killer Boy Snap big comics companies like DC and Marvel have their own multiverses. Basically there is main universe with main characters, and hella ton of  other universes, like, A LOT . Those range from simple alternative future( what if Peter Parker didnâ€™t marry Mary Jane at that time) to completely different ones ( Universe where Spider- Man is leader of anarchist punk people fighting with government or where X-men are established by Magneto , for example).  Marvel Cinematic Universe, by the way, is one of those alternative worlds, with number 199999. So is latest Spider Man game on PlayStation. So this animated film is rough adaptation of â€œMiles Morales: Spider Manâ€ù comic book, â€œSpider-Menâ€ù storyline and â€œSpider-verseâ€ù event. Spider-verse was an event where Spider characters from all universes fought off their common enemy.â€œMiles Moralesâ€ù originally takes place in Ultimate universe. Peter was Spider-Man there, but he died at age of 16 while fighting Green Goblin. Miles got bitten by one of Oscorp spiders and decided to take up his mantle and  thus becomes second Spider-Man of that world.  The same story will probably happen to animated version  of the character.â€œSpider-Menâ€ù storyline tells the story of how Peter from main Prime universe travelled to Ultimate universe, met Miles Morales, taught him things and learned truth about his counterpartâ€™s destiny. This animated film take a huge chunk out of that particular story.Now, Gwen Stacy is based on Earth-65 Gwen Stacy. She is one bitten by spider in that world. Peter becomes Lizard instead. She accidentally kills him  and decides to become superhero in order to redeem herself.The buff dude in black suit is adaptation of Spider-Man from Noir universe. The world of Noir is set in 1930s, during the Great Depression. Peter Parker lives in poor district controlled by local Mafia. His aunt May is killed by one of them. By lucky chance Peter is granted powers by some sort of Spider god. He uses his powers to avenge death of his family, kills bad dudes and becomes bloodlusted vigilante.Girl in big robot is animated version of Peni Parker. In original storyline she is daughter of â€œsuperhero copâ€ù guy, who used a exo-suit named â€œSp//drâ€ù to hunt enemy. Her dad is killed, and she is next one in line to work with the suit.  The animated version  seems to be more â€œcheerful animeâ€ù type and even her robot looks cuter than original.Last one is Spider-Ham. Basically a joke character from universe where everyone is an animal.Hope this clears things up.ï»¿"
"Long story short, the comic writers got bored, made a couple of Spider-Man-themed characters, and it kind of snowballed from there. This movie will feature the following Spider-People:Peter Parker, The Amazing Spider-Man: No introduction needed.Miles Morales, The Ultimate Spider-Man: A kid who got spider powers long after Peter's career started and is trying to be the next Spider-Man. He's the lead character in this movie.Gwen Stacy, The Sensational Spider-Gwen: Alternate version of Peter's first girlfriend who got spider powers instead of him.Peter Parker, The Spider-Man Noir: Alternate Peter Parker who got his powers in the 1930s.Peni Parker & SP//dr, The Spider-Mecha Duo: Relatively Unknown, but they are both based off of Japan Mecha animes. Spider-Ham: Looney Toons inspired joke character.ï»¿"

"I realize that but in this trailer she kinda acted like she wasn't romanticly interested in them but she was acting like they were her bueddies, like how lesbians act a bit tough and boyish, like vandal savage's daughter in DC.ï»¿"
"Shadow558 The Boss well her character is written as tomboyish. Since her mother is dead, her father was overprotective of her. This made her a bit more masculine( because no female figure in her life) and a rebel( because her dad is authority as a father and police chief).  She is self confident, independent( she had to become one, since dad is always working), foolishly brave and arrogant. Her arrogance is what caused Peter Parkerâ€™s death in her world, hence why she decided to become Spider-Woman/Ghost Spider.ï»¿"
"No, in the past, she have a crush in Peter (but he dead...)ï»¿"
"why r u being so defendent on this? It really isn't worth getting mad at me, it was a simple mistake dude.ï»¿"

In my opinion canon should only be peter parkerï»¿
Ace Fool then should we get rid of MCU Spider Man? He is not canon.ï»¿
AluTheHungryGhost umm my dude MCU Spiderman is peter parkerï»¿
"Ace Fool but he is different Peter Parker. His parents werenâ€™t SHIELD agents. He didnâ€™t make his own gadgets and proper suit, and got them from the Tony Stark.  He doesnt meet neither Betty Brant( host first gf) Gwen Stacy or Mary Jane or  Carlie Cooper. In fact in MCU he is with Michelle G. Thus, he doesnâ€™t have same life as real Peter, doesnâ€™t have same suit or powers as real Peter, he didnâ€™t kill people,as real Parker did. In fact, the only thing that makes him close with original Peter Parker is that he is white, male, and has same name.He is yet another alternative version of Spider Man, just like Spider Man Noir in this animated film, who s Peter Parker as well.ï»¿"
"AluTheHungryGhost He still has the same powers, Marvelâ€™s not showing the origin because itâ€™s well known already and would be a waste of time. And the Stark Suit (As named in Spider-Man PS4) is one of the closest suits to the comic suit. He has the same life, itâ€™s just more focused on High School as heâ€™s still young like in Ultimate Spider-Man comics.ï»¿"
"Raemonn Ramos  He doesnâ€™t have the same life. He is dating Michelle. Original Peter didnâ€™t know Michelle until after he got his masters degree. MCU Peter participated in â€œCivil Warâ€ù when he was fifteen. Original Peter participated in civil war, when he was in his mid 20s, and not only those events are entirely different, but MCU Civil war had no impact on Peters life, whereas original Peter lost his aunt and  his daughter. MCU Peterâ€™s best friend is Ned Leeds. Original Peter didnâ€™t even know the guy that much outside of the job at Daily Bugle.Their life choices, their experience, their surroundings ( family, friends, lovers) are so different, they are not the same person. Just like Ultimate Peter is not same person as original Peter. Yes, he is his counterpart, but counterpart doesnâ€™t mean â€œ same characterâ€ù.So if alternative versions like MCU Peter are allowed to exist, when why Miles or Peni cannot?ï»¿"

I'm happy it seems like they are putting focus on Miles developing into his own Spider-Man. I was worried they were gonna rush things and try to focus on all the characters instead of just the one.ï»¿
A black spiderman? Lololol I'm not racist but cmon.  And the black guy playing Spiderman is the protagonist from the movie 'Dope'ï»¿
I love how the black Spider-Man is the one you question even though there is a pig Spider-Man and an Asian robot controlling Spider-Man in this movie to. ØªÙˆÙ†Ù_ï»¿
"There's an anime Japanese schoolgirl Spidey who controls a mech, a talking pig, and a hardboiled noir detective voiced by Nicolas Cage but the black Spider-Man is where you draw the line?Sounds pretty racist to me.ï»¿"

Iâ€™m just wondering where spider-man of 2099 is?ï»¿
or superior spider-man or ben reillyï»¿
"I haven't read those comics, but is 2099 spidey from a different universe? Or is he just a future spiderman from the same universe as the OG Peter?ï»¿"
Yeah me too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That actually will be awesome in my opinion if the 2099 Spider Man was in this movieï»¿
"Robin John Aranguiz different Spider-Man, not peter but I forgot who it was, and heâ€™s from the futureï»¿"
In the sequel lolï»¿
@JAns Shns I think that his name is Miguel O Haraï»¿
"Robin John Aranguiz Itâ€™s very ambiguous, but he is meant to be in the future of the 616 earth. It usually depends on what the writer does as there isnâ€™t a definitive future of the 616 earth. Simplified answer is yes, he is from the same universe. Iâ€™d recommend starting with Peter Davidâ€™s original series for Spider-Man 2099. Dan Slott also did a 2099 arc during Superior Spider-Man, where Miguel gets stuck in the present. This coincides with the 2014 run and volume 3 which began in 2015 and ended in 2017. Thereâ€™s also the Timestorm universe, but thatâ€™s a completely different Miguel Oâ€™Hara.ï»¿"
"Jason Hu Theyâ€™ll probably reveal him this weekend at New York Comic Con. I know they are doing Marvel Legends reveals, maybe weâ€™ll get some more action figure reveals for this movie.ï»¿"
Jason Hu more like where is spider ben? Or ben reilly?ï»¿
"Spider-Man 2099 is already overused when it comes to these kinds of things (so is Spider-Ham and Noir but I think they're still pretty good choices). We got Shattered Dimension and Edge of Time both having 2099 and there's also the Ultimate Spider-Man show where they had Spider-Man 2099, Noir, and Spider-Ham (twice). There are more Spider-Men that we haven't seen being used before so seeing Noir and Ham being used again is kinda disappointing because we've already seen them before but I think they'll still be good characters for this movie anyway. There are so many other Spidey's that could've been used so a little more variety would've been great but this selection is still pretty good.ï»¿"

I'm so excited for this!ï»¿

the different art and animation styles look absolutely incredible. So hyped for this movie.ï»¿
"Why couldnâ€™t we just get a movie with just Miles and Peter? You know, the only two great and beloved characters in this trailer?We donâ€™t need all these characters that were too unpopular to even show up in f*cking Ultimate Spiderman, when that show did this plotline.ï»¿"
Most of the characters did show up you know. Just spider Gwen whoâ€™s getting her own animated TV show and the Japanese one with the mechï»¿
"PhasmaniaThat is... That is going to be an even worse flop than Disney XDâ€™s 2nd Spiderman show. Spider Gwen does not warrant a show about her.ï»¿"
Spencer Whiteway so doesn't miles. Miles is literally the most boring character in the group. At least the others have some interesting trait.ï»¿
Spider-Ham showed up in Return To The Spider-Verse and Spider-Man Noir was In Shattered Dimensions so the only one with no love is Peni Parkerï»¿
szeax You clearly havenâ€™t read the Miles story. The successor to peter after he died with invisibility and electrification is less interesting than spider pig? Spider Gwen? Please.ï»¿
"Phasmania eh, more interesting than spidergwen. But it's not that interesting.ï»¿"
Phasmania definitely less interesting than spiderhamï»¿
"Nope, not feeling it sorry _Ÿ˜©ï»¿"
too kiddyï»¿

"This actually seems like a really well written fun film. What I will never understand is why they would make a conscious decision to go with the choppy 10 frame per second look. It doesn't emulate traditional animation, it just makes the film look like a badly optimized videogame.ï»¿"
"If theyâ€™re gonna have Gwen Stacey, they have to reference what happened to her in Peterâ€™s universe. They canâ€™t not do that.ï»¿"

"What is this, CGI or 2D animation? Or are they combined? Because it's looking clean as hell.ï»¿"
"I think it's just CGI, but made to look like a combination.ï»¿"
CGI made to look like stop motion.ï»¿
It's CGI but the designers just made it frame by frame with few delays to make it more look appealing like in 2d style of animation. That's how animators nailed with The Lego Movie; same method. Yes it's attempting to be a stop motion.ï»¿
So trueï»¿
"CGI rendered at a lower frame rate like that of a low budget afternoon cartoon. I kind'a like the anime feel it gives it.ï»¿"
"crossover from another dimension.. 1:02like peter parker from sam raimi trilogypeni parker from sp//drand that suit behind Aunt May is from Spiderman PS4.. 1:39ï»¿"
@Afsakomig honestlyï»¿
"CGI with reduced frames to create a stop motion esque movement.The Peanuts Movie used a similar style as well.ï»¿"
"With these 2 characters the Japanese girl and that spider pig dude, it looks confusing as hell. I couldnâ€™t tell if they were 2D or 3D? I mean it actually looks pretty mad cool!!!!!!!!ï»¿"
Game of Life Good catchï»¿
"I believe that its called phong-shading. It's when you have a 3d model, but you refer it with a 2d material.ï»¿"
"Itâ€™s defiantly CGI but it is made to look like the comic book style, thatâ€™s why the characters often donâ€™t have realistic proportions such as the dadï»¿"
It just kinda confusing though _Ÿ_”_Ÿ_”_Ÿ_”ï»¿
"Brayden Tidswell THIS PATH IS WHAT ALL MOVIES STRIVE FORï»¿"
They rendered with a toon style 3D shader.ï»¿
Itâ€™s a comic book style 3D CGI.ï»¿
Nintendude 1216 it's made to look like a comic book style then all the other spider men/women have their own unique style like spider pig has a looney toons style of animationï»¿
Unreal Engine 4ï»¿
"Well actually it's a mix of both, 2D used for the on screen ""bangs"" and other onomatopoeia, as well as explosion effects, etc.ï»¿"
OH MY GOD I want to see this so badly now!ï»¿
"Not black,,ï»¿"
2:16 peni cannot climb the walls?ï»¿
Darktommy3 Shes isnâ€™t sheâ€™s being pulled the the othersï»¿
Gwen and Miles are keeping her in place which I find really cute Iâ€™m guessing sheâ€™s holding their backs and has her legs behind her thereâ€™s still gotta be room for Spider-Ham to make it through thoughï»¿
but if she is a spider girl why cannot climb the walls?ï»¿
Darktommy3 1:38 She got bitten by a spider and can telepathically control that robot.ï»¿
a different type of spider thenï»¿

"Seriously what's up with dumb comic book cops always trying to kill or arrest superheroes like Spiderman? Yeah. Yeah. I get it, he's a vigilante. And so doesn't have the authority over the law. But you also live in a universe where criminals have access to sci fi tech and magic, and constantly get invaded by aliens every week. So again, until you upgrade the tech tree for the police you idiots should be grateful for heroes like Spiderman risking their lives for no money while doing your jobs. There's dumb and there's Marvel comics human dumb. I mean let's say you do arrest or shoot him. What happens next time when Green Goblin or some other crazy villain is destroying the city and you police can't do squat? Who'll save you all then idiots? Also, when the Kree, Skruell, Hydra or Kang the conqueror tries to destroy or enslave you who else but the heroes would save you?ï»¿"

"(The parable of the wedding feast):The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son, And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.all things are ready: come unto the marriage. But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:Then saith he to his servants,The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy. Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good:and the wedding was furnished with guests.And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment: And he saith unto him,Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.Then said the king to the servants,Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. (HELL!)For many are called,but few are chosen.(Matthew 22:2-3;4-5; 8-10;11-14).***The King is God the Father and the Son is Jesus.***The invitations were sent out long before the celebration so the people would have plenty of time to get ready.***(They made light of it): Means they did not care about it. They were so preoccupied with the here and now that they had no concern for God's kingdom.***The indifferent response in V.5 describes Israel at the time of Jesus earthly ministry.***(Both bad and Good): Probably refers to Jews and Gentiles. The morally evil and the morally good. The important point to recognize is that this group responded to the invitation, while those who had received special invitations had spurned the king's bidding.***(Did not have on a wedding garment): Like the others, this visitor had been invited to the wedding but he failed to prepare himself for it.----->I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. (Revelation 3:18).***In Revelation, the garments of (fine linen) worn by the (bride of the Lamb) is said to be the (righteous deeds) of the (saints).----------->And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the (fine linen) is the (righteousness of saints).(Revelation 19:8).***In this parable, the garment may refer to the righteousness of Christ graciously provided for us though his death. To refuse to put it on would mean a refusal of Christ's sacrifice.***If we want to enter Christ's banquet, we must ""Put on"" the righteousness he gives us. ---->And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. (Ephesians 4:24). ---->And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: (Colossians 3:10).***Someone claiming to belong at the wedding while refusing to wear the correct garments was similar to the Israelites who claimed to be God's people while refusing to OBEY HIM.***(Cast...into outer darkness): Referring to the judgment--->Hell...***(Many are called, but few are chosen): The word called in this instance refers to being ""invited"", not to the call of God as Paul used the word. (Rom 8:28-29).***All Israel had been invited, but only a few would (accept) and (follow Jesus). Not all those invited will be among the chosen of God, for not (all will believe).ï»¿"

Is that a Japanese Anime girl...with her Spider-Mecha?ï»¿
I HAVE NO CLUE xDï»¿
"She's Peni Parker, who fights crime as ""SP//dr"". She's a 14 year old Japanese girl who's got a mental link to a radioactive spider that bit her and is the only person who can pilot the spider-mecha as a result.ï»¿"
"James G So instead of wearing tight suit that symbolize like a Spider, she came up with her own idea of fighting crime using the old AND modern Japanese genius-inventor-nerd tradition, and that is riding a Spider-mecha SUIT?!ï»¿"
DxW 00 She actually took over being SP//dr from her father after he died. He's the one who made the spider-mecha. She let herself get purposefully bitten by the radioactive spider so that she would be able to pilot the mecha.ï»¿
The comic she first appeared in was written by the guy from My Chemical Romance.ï»¿

"@Dell12 16 There's no reason for them make that sort of budget cut. Besides, it makes sense in the context of the characters. It's actually a lot smoother than it was in the initial reveal. They just tweaked the style. It's basically stop motion.ï»¿"

Why is Spider-Man black?ï»¿
PlaceOfOrigin It's Miles Morales. Takes up the mantle of Spiderman after Peter dies.ï»¿
PlaceOfOrigin I love you question how Spider-Man is black but not that he is also a talking pig.ï»¿
MrLondonuts what do mean heâ€™s a talking pig? That doesnâ€™t make sense. I canâ€™t understand why thy were pressured into making spider-man black? Can a white person play the character Shaft if they ever make another film? Doubt it.ï»¿
"PlaceOfOrigin did you even watch the trailer? There is a pig Spider-Man in this movie aswell, there is also an Asian girl who controls a robot spider. You donâ€™t have a problem with that, but once Spider-Man is black itâ€™s an issue???ï»¿"
MrLondonuts I donâ€™t mind suspending reality and watching talking pigs. But we both know that this spider-man is black because of some sort of social equality. Itâ€™s ridiculous.ï»¿
MrLondonuts there would be a huge outcry if Shaft was cast as a white man. Tell me the difference?ï»¿
"PlaceOfOrigin There is also a female Spider-Man and an Asian Spider-Man in this film. No problem with them? But the black one Oooo something is wrong there.And no we donâ€™t both know that. This is a film about different dimension spider people, these characters are all characters that have been established throughout the last 50 years in comic books.  Miles is a popular alternate Spider-Man and has existed for ages, so he just happens to be in this film, you making a big deal over nothing, what would you have preferred if they turned miles white??ï»¿"
"MrLondonuts the pig, the woman, the Asian, are not ACTUALLY spider-man though, are they? Now youâ€™re going to say â€œwell, Morales isnâ€™t actually Spider-man either, heâ€™s taking over from Peter Parkerâ€ù. But you donâ€™t see it, do you? They SPECIFICALLY making him black. Which isnâ€™t right. I have no agenda but I totally disagree with being shamed into feeling that â€œwhitesâ€ù have had their way for too long and itâ€™s time for a change. Itâ€™s an awful ideology. The pig, the woman, the Asian, thatâ€™s NOT the point.ï»¿"
"MrLondonuts spider-man is a white person. Is that such a bad thing? If you want a pig as a superhero or a woman or an Asian then by all means write something and hey-ho, good luck to you. By why take a character who is white and change their race? Itâ€™s not only spider-man that this happened to. Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve seen other examples.ï»¿"
"PlaceOfOrigin what do you mean â€œSpider-Man is whiteâ€ù did you not see the trailer, you are like completely missing the point and again, I donâ€™t understand why there is no problem with an Asian Spider-Man and animal Spider-Man and yes, they are all spider men/people. They are from alternate universe and are the spider person from thier respective universe. Ok using your logic. What about spider Gwen, the original Spider-Man is a boy but sheâ€™s a girl, why is there no issue thier either. You make no sense, you have a problem with him being black and you think there is some hidden agenda there. The only way a black Spider-Man would be an issue is if they called him Peter Parker and he was just   Written as peter but black, that would be an issue, but miles is a different character with spider abilities, he has a different story just like peni Parker just like peter porker and just like Gwen. THERE IS NO ISSUE LOL. And your acting like peter isnâ€™t in this, he is there and a main character in this story. Again, would you prefer if they made miles and peni white? Made Gwen a boy? Made peter porker a human? Where is your line?ï»¿"
"Pig - Gets bitten by radioactive spider. OKJapanese girl - Gets bitten by a radioactive spider.OKAfrican person - bitten by a radioactive spiderWTF NO THIS IS WRONG SPIDERMAN IS WHITE.Thatâ€™s you. Thatâ€™s you right now.ï»¿"
MrLondonuts 95% of the trailer is about Miles Morales. NOT the woman NOT the pig NOT the Asian. Itâ€™s called slight of hand. THE MAIN CHARACTER IS MILES MORALES. They are changing spider-manâ€™s race.ï»¿
"PlaceOfOrigin â€œthey are changing Spider-Manâ€™s raceâ€ù THERE ARE MULTIPLE SPIDER PEOPLE, they come in different shapes ages races and sizes, thatâ€™s not an issue and have no idea why you see it as so. Of course the movie has to have a focus, the focus is in miles universe,  thatâ€™s where all the characters end up, miles universe is different to peters and weâ€™ve seen peters universe a billion times,as I said earlier if they changed peters race to black that would be an issue but Miles morales Isnâ€™t peter Parker, Gwen isnâ€™t peter Parker, peni Parker isnâ€™t peter, Parker, peter porker isnâ€™t peter Parker but like or not my guy, they are all SPIDERMAAAAN. They are all different in their own ways and thatâ€™s ok. Honestly itâ€™s unfortunate there are people out there who see different as wrong. If you had a problem with any Spider-Man that wasnâ€™t white, Iâ€™d probably just leave you be but the fact that out of all the different spider people in this film the one you have the problem with is the black one is just odd.  Thatâ€™s allï»¿"
MrLondonuts youâ€™re being an apologist.ï»¿
PlaceOfOrigin You know what after heavy thinking Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that you are right. Spider-Man can and should only be white how dare they make him a pig! Letâ€™s sue the pig race. We want our friendly neighbourhood Caucasian Spider-Man! How dare Hollywood push their pig agenda on us.ï»¿

Left with no other choice, President Kanye was forced to inflate the dollar until a small meal might cost upwards from 30 000$ in order to pay reparations to the other countries. At the moment in the spiderman universe, they are in a horrible depression, capitalism is failing, unemployment rates have never been higher, and unfortunately, world war 4 might be the only thing that can pull america out of this horrible economic climate.So yup, world war 3 confirmed in this universeï»¿"

Miles Morales is the Spider-Man of ultimate universe after Peter Parker dies. Ultimate came out more than a decade ago...ï»¿

Rajanikant amazing Spiderman is the worse version. He didn't act like Peter parker at all in the movie. Just a Popular snotty teenager who wasn't nerdy or shy at all. Spiderman is the only time Peter gets funny not without the costume Wich is why people like the original Spiderman movies moreï»¿

How does Noir Spider-Man stick to the wall? In the comics he can't stick because he wears rubber gloves.ï»¿
Hes between two other spider people. Maybe theyre holding him up?ï»¿
"lucas Pretty sure most spider-men have the ability to manipulate magnetic fields to stick to walls rather than having actual sticky hands. This is why electro can disable spider-mans wall crawlingï»¿"
"its cagequestion it and you dieï»¿"
"In the original series he can't, but, for the spider-verse event and the following stories they just gave him the power to do it to fit in with the rest of the spiders that's why he can do it in this movieï»¿"
So it's a power he obtained in the Spyder-verse crossover.ï»¿

"I HAVE A THEORY:So after thanosâ€™s click spider man left the dimension they were in then went to that dimension to meet the younger version of him who hasnâ€™t grown up yet ( the opposite of his age) and the kid is also black ( the opposite of his skin colour) and his uncle is alive instead of auntie( opposite with white Spider-Man )ï»¿"
That black kid is Miles Morales. Peter Parker is dead in his universe so he took the responsibility to the next spiderman.ï»¿
Milind Shekhawat Ye but itâ€™s opposite dimension so odd he wouldnâ€™t be called peter parkerï»¿
Not opposite universeï»¿

"""-Spider man - Earth 616 (the classic) "" He doesn't seem like 616 Pete though. Seems like a completely new one or maybe one that's an amalgamation of a bunch of the Peters into one mentor character. He went through the same stuff as the Pete from the original movie trilogy but his personality doesn't seem to actually be that Pete. Also this version of Miles does not seem to be the same Miles from the comics (the one who originated from 1610 but was ported over to the 616). Would have been dope if the Pete mentoring Miles was indeed the one from the Sam Raimi universe complete with Tobey as the voice actor.ï»¿"

Wow spiderman's shortï»¿
Are they just cranking these movies out so they can stick the toys in McDonaldâ€™s happy meals?ï»¿
I'm thinking they are cranking them out because they are insanely popular and make millions of dollars for the studios making them.....ï»¿
SD Brand Just like McDonaldâ€™s happy meals?ï»¿
@uslsuspect Yes actually. . ... but that didn't back up your original statement whatsoever....ï»¿
SD Brand then let me be more clear: You were supporting the decision to make these movies based on their popularity. One of the most popular restaurants in the world is McDonaldâ€™s. One of the most popular cars is probably the Ford Focus. Popular does not equal quality. Perhaps were saying the same thing. They keep making the movies because they make money. I was surprised to see that Jerry Springer was on the air for two decades but I guess if the money is rolling in why quit putting out material. I donâ€™t wanna argue with you. I hope it meets your expectations.ï»¿
@uslsuspect Again you jave strayed so far from what your original point was.. ...ï»¿
SD Brand You strayed so far that you left your sentence with an ellipses.ï»¿

I'm glad one of the big production companies finaly decided to take a risk with animationï»¿
"I'm here because it's not God's will that any of you perish but all of you repent to receive eternal life. Many people are not prepared for the return of Jesus Christ. I've seen Him and He looks nothing like the famous pictures. He is coming back soon to judge the world. Repentance is a gift, now is the time to seek Him and turn away from all wrongful acts before it's too late.Many die suddenly and unexpectedly everyday, these are our friends and family. They enter hell for all eternity, because they died without Jesus Christ. I don't wish to see anyone of you in agony for all eternity. I'm in oneness with God's will. He loves and cares for you all.You have the voice to change the eternal destination of your friends and family members, if your willing. God will not force His will on anyone. If you care about them than you know the right decision, come work for the only kingdom that will last forever, if your willing. I wish to see many of you changed into the image of Christ and all for His Glory. I wish to see all you guys reunited in God's kingdom with your friends and family, but that will not happen unless you are willing to do God's will.If your willing seek God with all your heart until you find Him. He will speak to you at His time, once He does obey Him until the end, and even unto death. Your reward will be with Him in the only kingdom that will last forever, heaven.Take care and God bless youï»¿"

"Peace, Here is an online english translation of the Quran - W W W . Q U R A N . C O M please read it, or listen to the english translation on youtube. Also if you believe in God and believe Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him is the last and final prophet and messenger sent by God. Then say 'Ash hadu ana la ilaha ill Allah wa ash hadu anna Muhammadan abduhu wa Rasul Allah"" ""I bear witness there is nothing worthy of worship except God and prophet Muhammad is his last an final messenger"" Those words are the ticket to paradise. When you say that all your sins are forgiven by God and all your good deeds stay with you and you become a Muslim. A Muslim is a person who peacefully submit's his will to God. Once you become a Muslim you have joined a family of over a billion people. After saying the shahadah straight away you are guaranteed paradise Masha'Allah _Ÿ˜€ Peaceï»¿"

Never understood that excuse people are making up for this flick.ï»¿
It's like turning a page when reading a comic. That's what I'm understanding.ï»¿
"@MrAmazing79 that's what I kinda thought at first, but that's not an animation style, that's not how comic books really work, its not a flipbook, it's different panels with different pictures. When the Lego movie's animation looked like stop motion it made sense because of all of the fan films created through stop motion. But comic books aren't an animation style, it's just pictures, there is no movementï»¿"
Itâ€™s almost like a stop motion animation now if you donâ€™t like it too bad so stop whining or youâ€™ll turn from semi decent to head unpleasantï»¿
"@Kleckio I'm not whining, I'm just pointing out it's not a good reason to slow down the frame rate. If you like it cool, but dont let other people not liking something bother you so muchï»¿"
Sorry itâ€™s just that I was really pissed offï»¿
"your'e fine man, no hard feelingsï»¿"

Sony has a Spiderman game and then makes a Spiderman movie. Why didn't they follow the story from the game of how miles dad saves Spiderman and dies and then miles gets bit by a spider. In my opinion that is better than different dimensions.ï»¿

"Hikarizu1 Yeah. Itâ€™s part of his animation style, along with the edge tracing, to make him feel more like a comic book. Iâ€™m sure Miles, Peter, and Gwen have different animation styles. They may be harder to see straight up, but they may have different styles of walking/moving and other animation effects (like Peterâ€™s lower FPS effect), and possibly even slightly different shaders.ï»¿"

@jacob munger How is he a wannabe if he IS Spider Man? He's the Spider Man of a different universe....ï»¿
"@MrAmazing79 False. He was around when Pete was still alive. The Ultimate Universe Peter died, not the main one. When the main one ""died"" Doc Ock took over as Spiderman. Miles never replaced anybody as the main Spider Man.ï»¿"
@SD Brand that's what i mean. In the ultimate universe he's the new spider man.ï»¿
@SD Brand Peter Parker is Spider-Man. Literally anyone else is just a wannabeï»¿

Look guys this movie looks fantastic but they really should have done something with Spider-Man 2099 because he has probably been in more games than any other Spider-Man variant (Besides Peter Parker) and I mean when I think of other spidermen he is the first one to come to mind and I just think he could have been a great addition and character to this movie but I mean this movie is going to be great. Like or reply if you agree!ï»¿

"RichDXtreme247 she is peni parker, the mecha spider man.ï»¿"
"She's Peni Parker, she's was part of the Spider-Verse canon in the comics. Her entire thing is that she's got a psychic link to a spider and can use that to control this spider-mecha suit. Her character and comic stories are inspired a lot by anime tropes obviously, but she looked a lot less ""kawaii-anime"" in the comics. I guess they really wanted to empathise her anime gimmick in the movie, since she's basically the ""anime representative"" of the Spider crew.ï»¿"
"Huh...I never knew there was another Pen-type Parker (I heard of Penny/Penelope Parker - Earth 11). This is the first time I've ever heard of ""Peni"". Interesting. I like it.ï»¿"

If anything you should be more interested in Sonyâ€™s track record, like you said they donâ€™t tend to make very good movies, so Iâ€™m more inclined to assume this will suck too. Donâ€™t get me wrong Iâ€™d love for this to be awesome, but until Iâ€™ve seen it a trailer is just not enough to encourage me to look past the indiscretions of Sonyâ€™s past.ï»¿"

"MildGonolini Read that I typed â€œmaybeâ€ù cause yeah I dont know for sure but just from seeing the animation present in all three trailers as well as art direction anc lighting and the unique for Spiderman film story premise it looks like its shaping up to be what I said it might. Theres so many great choices made here like how the individual characters subtlety or overtly are drawn different from looking like the same animation style, the shading making things pop and look like im actually looking at the pages of a comic book and seeing 2D attempting 3dimensions yet its not grating to the eyes but smooth and enjoyable.ï»¿"

"This movie is unnecessary. No hate to Spider-Man, it's just that you can have Lego Batman Movie with a motion picture Batman already out there. This doesn't seem like the right time at all to have an animated Spider-Man movie come out in between two years that will have a motion picture Spider-Man. Also knowing that the character, Miles Morales, is not even 10 years old since his comic book debut, it seems even more unnecessary to have him in a movie like this and tease him for a motion picture. Too soon and too wrong. Wrong? Wrong being the backstory is gonna be a bit more altered than it should even be. Yeah, since when did they ever get any superhero's origin story right on the big screen? Fine, but still, don't mess his origin story up with a spider-verse already. It looks really messy and I don't like it at all. The quality of Spider-Man movies have been going down since TASM 1 & 2 in my opinion. Homecoming was overrated and I wouldn't watch it twice. MCU's gonna mess up Peter Parker after 2019, and the MCU will go to crap afterwards, but not just because of Peter Parker's remaining life on screen in the MCU.ï»¿"
"S K E E T who said that this was related to Lego batman? And miles has been out long enough... And the movie is about the spiderverse, it's not just about miles. They don't have to build this up like the mcu.ï»¿"
"szeax   Sorry for the confusion. No, I didn't mean to say it's connected to Lego Batman. Well, if they don't provide an explanation to how the other Spiders got their powers, then I'd say it would need some sort of a build up. I'm only saying this because the general audience who mainly keep up with Marvel movies in general only know how Peter Parker got his powers.ï»¿"

@Derek Ray Vidana its just an animated Spider-Man movie. Animation was probably the best way to go with a crazy concept like this. Its supposed to look like a comic book. Its also to bring lesser known characters like Miles Morales and Spider-Gwen into the mainstream. It looks like a fun animated movie. What's so wrong about that?ï»¿
Aeryk_Angst The animation style (not the way they move but the art) is similar to that of the Emoji Movie and we all know Emoji Movie - Trashï»¿
Derek Ray Vidana and what does that have to do with anything? So now things can't have remotely similar artstyles?ï»¿
@Derek Ray Vidana Idk what movie you saw but this looks literally nothing like the artstyle of The Emoji Movie. I know it was trash. But your using the Emoji movie as a means to downplay this movie for no reason.ï»¿
Your Deepest Of Fears Pretty much not if itâ€™s by the same company that made the Emoji movie.ï»¿

It's NOT a superhero-team up story. Those characters are different versions of the same concept. There is no dynamic and drama. But hey, that's like THE thing now look at MCU.Also after all these years I have 0 confidence in Sony animation's storytelling skills. Introducing Millis, Gwen and Spidernoir at once sounds like a disaster.ï»¿"

That's not what they mean. They mean at the time of it's release it'll only be in theatres. They say Christmas because it's release date is close to Christmas. It won't only be in theatres for a day.

Kai just because it was made in 2014 doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m gonna like it. I donâ€™t rly care how old it is I just dont like the idea.ï»¿
"Alex Alarcon Do you have literally any reason that doesn't just involving writing the entire thing off as ""she's anime""? Some critique on her character, her design, or something? Like, if your complaint was that she clashes with the rest of the movie I could understand, but that's sort of undermined by the fact that Spider-Ham clashes way more but you're seemingly fine with that, not to mention that the fact that they clash is sort of the point in the first place. Don't get me wrong I get that this is your opinion and that's fine, I just find it odd.ï»¿"
James G I rly donâ€™t like the mech. I donâ€™t get how sheâ€™s anime tho. Donâ€™t know where u got that from. And spider ham does his own thing  and is obviously a joke character. I mean at least he has his own powers.ï»¿
"""I don't get how she's anime"". Are you actually for real, or what?And Peni Parker (aka ""SP//dr"") has a psychic link to a radioactive spider. It's how she can pilot the mecha, so yes, she does have her own powers. They're just not the same kind as the others.ï»¿"
@Alex Alarcon that's completely fine I'm also not too fussed about it either.ï»¿
James G meh. I still donâ€™t like her. I donâ€™t rly count that as powers.ï»¿
James G btw anime is a cartoon that was made in japan. Yes this is has a cartoon style but still isnâ€™t a cartoon. So technically not anime.ï»¿
"Well not everyone's gonna like every character, so I don't care if you don't like her. Just don't undermine her or toss her idea out for no reason is what I'm saying. And ""anime"" is a Japanese style. She's made to be anime. Something doesn't need to be made in Japan to be anime in nature. Her entire gimmick in this movie is that that she's the ""anime one"" in the Spider crew. How do you not get this.ï»¿"

Money the original Spider-verse story actually featured that Spider-Manï»¿
"@Money the 1973 Spiderman series was made through a collaboration between Toei and Marvel. It included a giant robot called Leopardon. Marvel also collaborated on the third Super Sentai series (the first two were technically originally Sentai, as they had no giant robots), Battle Fever J - the first Super Sentai series to feature giant robots. Power Rangers uses footage from Super Sentai (the original series used footage from Zyuranger). So yes, Spiderman is basically the reason that the Power Rangers use giant robots.ï»¿"
"There are several actually. There's at least 5 Marvel character's anime that I know of. Many more out there probably.There is also a Mangaverse, which is straight up Marvel comics in manga style.Though Peni is originally not actually anime/manga. She's a character that carries influences from anime, like Big Hero 6. They just made an anime styled version of her for the movie.ï»¿"

Spider Pigï»¿
Iâ€™m confused as hell. So miles morales is the spiderman in the ultimate universe. So why is peter Parker teaching miles like he hasnâ€™t been spiderman. At first I thought miles had powers he just didnâ€™t know and peter helped him learn how to use them. But from this trailer we gather spiderman (miles) is well known from his dad ranting about spiderman. This means he is already spiderman and fighting crime. So why later is peter â€œtrainingâ€ù miles to simply web swing in a shitty costume? It canâ€™t be that officer davis is complaining about peter spiderman because we already know peter is from a different universe and that miles is the spiderman in their universeï»¿
Great video this trailer is amazing and it looks fun to watch.ï»¿

"I will admit, I'm a bit hesitant on this. The Angry Birds movie and Emoji Movie don't inspire any confidence, but I hope that this works out. Although, I'm not going to lie, the main thing that this has going for it, from my standpoint, is the fact that its going to be the first movie in a long time, if ever, (that I can remember), that combines 2d and 3d throughout the film, and unlike other movies, like the Coco opening paper animation and Maui's tattoo, has the 2d animation styled characters be their own. The Coco opening's 2d was used to tell a story, but not their own characters, and while Maui's tattoo, you could argue, was its own character, I think of it as an extension of Maui's. Just wanted to make it clear. But I must say, I really think that going with that design choice is what is going to make Anime-Spider-Mech (Peni Parker) and Spider-Ham (Peter Porker) work. Using anime style for Peni Parker and cartoon style for Spider-Ham were excellent choices that represent each character exceptionally. I won't pretend that I know anything about Peni other than her name (and the fact that she was based on anime), but Spider-Ham as a cartoon was probably one of the best design choices in this movie. I just hope that they still apply cartoon physics to some extent. Using different styles for different types of universes, (Spider-Man Noir is slightly different from the other three 3d characters) is an interesting and creative design choice.TLDR: I'm both excited and worried about this movie. Sony could mess it up bad, I'm not ruling that out, but it isn't looking like this company will. The story, while seeming somewhat simple, will allow the many characters (Spider-Man OG, Spider-Man Miles, Spider-Girl Gwen, Spider-Girl Anime, Spider-Man Noir, Spider-Ham, and still crossing my fingers for Spider-Man 2099) to develop and, arguably more importantly, interact. I've got my hopes up for this movie. Sony, if you mess this (and Venom) up, prepare to get destroyed by the internet.ï»¿"

"Ugh cant even get gwen's hair right. All these excited comments and no ones noticing how out of place some of this seems, the style of paper book animation with the computer stop motion type style just dont match that well. Specifically shown in the fall scene with the two swinging. This is also the only movie having Peter Parker being an adult compared to the live action marvel timelines having it being hi begining. I do like the idea it's just going to throw off the timeline because obviously this will 9/10 get a second installment. The styles being mixed was a cute idea at first but in some places just doesn't work, and by this I mean having some characters look more cartoony than 3 block like models. Yes I enjoy Spider-Man, yes I enjoy the multi-verse, but dear lord could we have made some of the scenes way more appealing.ï»¿"

Brite Bomber I have a feeling youâ€™ve only read one comic in your life.ï»¿
Donald Glover shouldâ€™ve been miles in this movie. But this looks really good though.ï»¿
that would be kinda odd considering Donald Glover had a cameo as Miles's uncle int eh Spider-Man: Homecoming film.ï»¿
"the cartoonist this movie looks like it has nothing to do with the mcu. Mileâ€™s uncle is already in this movie as another actor. Donald voiced miles in the ultimate spiderman cartoon, so I donâ€™t think itâ€™d be too odd.ï»¿"
"oh, ok. i didn't know about the ultimate spider-man cartoon.ï»¿"
Wow this animated spider man movie best ever blasting the old animation records I think ....ï»¿
Easter egg @ 1:38ï»¿
Spiderman is black now? Is Batman gonna be Asian or Mexican in the next movie?ï»¿
You're so dumb. Miles Morales is Spider-Man for a long time nowï»¿
"You ask yourself why is he black?Because no one should be a outsider (we are not racist/sexist right guys?!!) The next spiderman is a woman or disabled orr a disabled womanï»¿"
1:37 OMG it's Spider-Chanï»¿
Boredï»¿
This looks so dumbï»¿
Jorge Gonzales Nope. Sorry youâ€™re not an actual fan.ï»¿
"@Benjamin Ruggles Um, that's why I said it looks dumb. Because to be a fan would mean that I enjoy it, and I don't. Glad we're in agreement.ï»¿"
pizza theme intensifiesï»¿
spidermans.... black now. just like star fire from teen titans. one of the ghost busters from the new one. what is it with changing characters for social brownie points? theyrd be an outrage if a black character got changed white.ï»¿
Poles only miles is blackï»¿
did you watch the trailer??????ï»¿
Poles Starfire is an alien. There is no correct ethnicity for her. Miles has existed for years. Jesus man do your research.ï»¿

Whereâ€™s the pile of dust for MCU spideyï»¿
I'm still pissed that they took Solo away from Lord and Miller and I just want this movie to do so well to show that Disney was wrong.ï»¿
"Yeah, Iâ€™m fine with just Peter Parker.ï»¿"
Robert Targaryen Guess youâ€™re not an actual fan otherwise youâ€™d know these guys have been around a while.ï»¿

"This is what you call a spiderman movie, not that spiderman homecoming crap, that's in no real connection with the comics. Full of jokes, and seems like a captain america in a suit of powers. I love how this film links with the spiderverse and all of that.ï»¿"
"Imagine a live action spider verse story, which follows the comics (with Morlun and the other spider hunters) that would be so awesome. Still pumped for this movie!ï»¿"
Itd be funny if they were seeing all the Spider-Men that arrived and then a bunch of dust just arrivedï»¿

Then why are you in the comment section of a trailer for a Spider-Man movie?ï»¿
the art style is amazing!ï»¿
Why so many dislikes on such a sweet piece of art?ï»¿
"Whether it's good or bad or somewhere inbetween, the alt-right is traumatized whenever a movie doesn't just revolve around a white guy.ï»¿"
One word: Opinions.ï»¿
DejaVoodooDoll nice straw manï»¿
"@Eric AlveloDon't ever lose that innocence.ï»¿"
DejaVoodooDoll That has nothing to do with innocence. One of the main characters is clearly a white guy.ï»¿
"He said Alt-right, not ""the Right"". If you don't think the Alt-right is racist then you're out of your little mind.ï»¿"
Sovereign DC Doesnt really make a difference. This is the first thread to ever bring race into thisï»¿
"Sovereign DC Oof, I forgot what the extreme right stands forï»¿"
Born of Fire lmfao i love this threadï»¿
Born of Fire i literally couldnâ€™t give two shits about his race itâ€™s all about the characterizationï»¿
selektMike Sonyï»¿
"@Born of FireAll the incel sites lean more towards your politics, when they're not pretending to be nice guys, so don't talk trash about your friends. But thanks for providing a demonstration of that famous alt right racism I mentioned earlier.ï»¿"
"@DejaVoodooDoll yeah, the problem with that theory is that there are more dislikes now than there are alt-right. Multiple accounts, I suppose, but who's really that petty, eh? Personally, I'm not a fan of low frame character animations. The jerky way they more irritates me. If it wasn't for the fact that I really like the Miles Spider-Man, and having a whole bunch of different spiders all in one place is so amusing, I would likely have disliked it. Instead, I'll neither like, nor dislike.ï»¿"
"Well, to find out, let's play ""Spot The Hater!""ï»¿"
@Born of Fire Found him. That didn't take long.ï»¿
DejaVoodooDoll u pulled the race card a little to fastï»¿
"Lmao why did you make it political, some people just don't like Spider-man y'know...ï»¿"
-Lord where have you been then? Iâ€™ve seen it on every trailer thread.ï»¿
"@Ryan GunnIf you think there's less than 9 thousand alt-righters out there, you ought to check the viewcounts on their videos. Or look at how many politicians are kissing their asses. But kudos for not being one of them. The frame rate's fair criticism. Personally, I don't mind it, if it means each frame looks this good.ï»¿"
DejaVoodooDoll Look a leftist playing the race card. Shocker!ï»¿
Because there was an anime girl in there and the main protagonist is a black male that looks like he's 13 and is friends with an adult that is teaching him how to become Spiderman without his own parents permission.ï»¿
angelduck 16 Pretty shitty ones at best if weâ€™re being honest here.ï»¿
This art style is amazing with the booms and thwipsï»¿
Like pause at 2:06 look at that backgroundï»¿
Lucas 7777 he is 13 or 14ï»¿
"DejaVoodooDoll actually, it's probably because the director supports a domestic terrorist organization.  I'm not even a fan of Marvel, I just wanted to check out the comments.  LOLï»¿"
"@Three60CrusaderOh, right. I forgot, racism ceased to exist the moment America elected Obama president. Also, sexism. I'm still not sure how the world solved those problems, but it was probably due to social media and X-Box Live.ï»¿"
Because a lot of people are biased against Sony's Spider-Man moviesï»¿
DejaVoodooDoll i have nothing against black people and i want racist people to jump out of a window but maybe people dont want him to changeï»¿
the racistï»¿
"@CRAZY GAMERAt least it's not One More Day or the Clone Saga.ï»¿"
"@DejaVoodooDoll without ""white guys"" you wouldn't be enjoying the Internet right now and this shitty little movie wouldn't even exist.ï»¿"
@DejaVoodooDoll lmao another Race baiter.ï»¿

"Born of Fire Anyone who uses â€œsoyboy,â€ù as an insult, donâ€™t take them seriously.ï»¿"
DejaVoodooDoll Or maybe more views will inevitably result in more people seeing it that don't like it.ï»¿
"Marco Trapoja without native Americans, Asians and Africans it wouldnâ€™t exist either. Whatâ€™s your point? If you think someone is race baiting its dumb to use race as an argument for a response especially when you make yourself look stupid.ï»¿"
DejaVoodooDoll and we found the politics addictï»¿
DejaVoodooDoll I mean same logic can be applied to the left. They disliked it because it has too many white Spider heroes.ï»¿
selektMike Racists mad about a black Spider-man.ï»¿
Because he's blackï»¿
hiï»¿
And you're traumatized that nothing ever revolve around blacks.ï»¿

"Something taken directly from the comic books? The multiverse has been a thing in the comics since forever. There's been a crap ton of events in the canon involving multiple Spider people. And Spider-Ham/Peter Porker has been around for decades. Like it or not this is all part of Spider-Man canon, so I'm afraid you're gonna have to deal with it. I get that a lot of people don't follow the comic canon so this'll seem outta nowhere to them, but this is based on the comics. Which, you know, is the actual original canon.ï»¿"

"MrGear are you actually that ignorant? I wanna see you do animations, most animations are made into 30 fps. This movie takes more talent than all your videos combine :) P.S. Stop rehashing video ideas you've posted before, very unprofessional and sleazy.ï»¿"
It's obviously a style choice. They could have easily made it 60 fps if they wanted to. This lower frame rate fits better with the comic book sort of style.ï»¿

"The fps is hurting me, because the art style and animation looks so goodï»¿"
It's a stylistic choice to make it look more like a comic book. Not every single thing has to be crystal clear 10 trillion frames a secondï»¿
It doesn't make it look more like a comic book though. It just makes it not look as good. Other than that everything looks greatï»¿
@KADE HOLMAN but it does though. Its a technique also used with the lego movie where there are so little inbetween frames that every frame looks like a key one. You can pretty much take out any shot and it looks good lolï»¿
"@Das It Mane yeah, but 25 would be nice. Even 20.ï»¿"
Yeah. It's the same thing for Dragon Ball FighterZ. I don't understand why people think that low frame-rate animation is ever a good artistic choice. It's just painful to look at.ï»¿
Cripple Jesus really I never noticed it in FighterZ though. Do you mean when the characters do their ults or just in general?ï»¿
"The characters are shaded like comic book characters (just look at Spider-Man Noir's design) and this more limited jolty movement is a very clear stylistic choice. It's not that it ""looks good"" or ""looks better"" without the higher frame rate, but it's so that the movie has a style. Also, if you're saying that the animation looks good, you're saying the fps looks good.ï»¿"

For some reason this movie runs at 15 frames per second. It's so lanky and twitchy it's insane... I am so dissapointed by the looks of it and the animations are off too. The plot seems to be terrible and overused with 0 real stakes in the play or room for character development and the voice acting is lacking. Spider-man PS4's cutscenes would make a better movie. Althought I will reserve final judgement after I watch the movie. For now it's a generous 4/10ï»¿

@TK-421 did Maguire effortlessly fight half of the avengers besides cap and win? No. Did Maguire figure out how to beat giant man almost instantly? No. Did Maguire fight thanos and almost win? Noï»¿
@TK-421 Maguire beat his enemies either because they were stupid or they turned good. And they all died. Tom Holland's spiderman beat vulture and saved him from dying. Has Maguire done the same? Noï»¿
"Really? Teary mcguire,  emo mcguire , cringy dancing mcguire? That one?ï»¿"
"@Prince Darwin Did Tom stop a train himself? No, did Tom got ravaged to the point of almost dying and still beat Green Goblin? No, did Tom fight Venom AND Sandman at the same time? No, and Tom was not even alone, he had the freaking Avengers at his side, Tobey was alone.ï»¿"
Is Tobey a whiny Iron Man Jr.? Noï»¿
@Colonel Mustard correction. Harry fought sand man. Toby got whooped by both sand man and venom. And he basically let gob beat him up. He only won because he jumped over a glider that killed gob. And Tom fought 4 or 5 avengers by himself (he took bucky and falcon on at once) and won against 3-4 by himself besides giant man which hes did most of the work. Toby would've gotten beaten up bad and would've needed help like always. And redirecting a plane so it doesnt cause another 9/11 is more impressive than stopping a train. And btw hes responsible for saving doctor strange and beating ebony mawï»¿
@Tricko toby is really whiny. I bet you if you add up all his crying scenes and put it all i none movie it would take up 10-15 percent of the timeï»¿
"@Prince Darwin Goblin didn't beat Sandman lol. Help like always? That was the first and last time he had a partner. No way an airplane is more impressive than a train. A train has tons of people, besides its multiple carts...Tom is just Ironman's cocksucker. And you disguise the situation. Dr. Octopus died because he drowned the machine and was the only way to stop it, if not, the city would be destroyed. In Homecoming there was zero chance the city would be in danger. Tobey a crybaby? Dude, he indirectly ""killed"" his best friend's father, and later, he lost that same friend in the same way his father passed away. Crying makes him a crybaby? Let's see if you don't cry if a psychopath kills your mother. Tom has not seen anyone dying except for Uncle Ben.ï»¿"
"@Colonel Mustard yes. Harry is the one that beat sandman. Not spiderman. He also needed his help fighting venom. And (flashback) spiderman was helped by an inanimate object in the norman fight. HE DID BARLEY ANY OF THE WORK IN ANY OF THE MOVIES WHILE FIGHTING THE MAIN VILLANS And think about this. The train if he didnt stop it would go into the water killing only the people inside the train. So maybe a couple hundred . If tom didn't redirect the plane it would crash into a bunch of tall buildings killing thousands. more deaths Than (like i said) 9/11 itself. And doc ock counts because he turned good and key word HELPED Toby save the city. And if dock was still bad toby would sacrifice himself. hed DIE. And then who would protect new york? Also If that doesn't happen the building wouldve dropped on ock or something and it would kill him and probably would drown the thing anyway. Again. Making pete do barley anything. Tom had to STRUGGLE. HE HAD A BIG CONCRETE BUILDING FALL ON TOP OF HIM. HE HAD TO STRUGGLE TO GET OUT OF IT. and another thing he had to STRUGGLE to fight vulture. And he barley won. And guess what? He saved him from dying. Unlike toby. And sand man didn't die because he basically cant die. Oh and another thing. He lost his girlfriend. Mary jane did nothing but be a living trash can. And she still got with toby. He basically gets everything handed to him. The only bad thing that happen to him are 1. Ben dies. And 2. Harry dies. Lets see what tom went through. Uncle ben died. He gets bullied constantly. He almost gets drowned. His friends almost die. He almost dies again. His favorite sandwitch place gets blown up. He kinda fails saving the ferry. Almost dies again.  And barley wins against vulture. And doesn't get with the girl. And in infinity war he goes into space to help save THE UNIVERSE. almost dies twice. Fights thanos and almost wins. But loses. Gets punched with giant fists. And loses. Again. Then he ""dies"" trying to protect the universe.. What has toby been doing? You can sit down now. And shut upï»¿"
"Prince Darwin he didnâ€™t fight avengers alone, he didnâ€™t fight thanos alone, he didnâ€™t even fight with vulture his wings were just exploded itselfï»¿"
"@TK-421 not in civil war. He fought cap, sam, and bucky all by himself. He had iron man and war machines help with giant man. But he did most of the work there. In IW yeah He had help. ITS THANOS. you are an ignorant biased imbecile if you think tobys spiderman could beat thanos by himself. Another thing. Toms spiderman fought almost all his battles by himself. Toby always had help whether it be a friend or by the villan itself. And in iw its pete helping them. Same with cw. But he had people help him once and thats it. In spiderman 1. Goblin beats up tobys pete bloody. And a minute later he kills himself. Spiderman 2. Ock beats up pete, turns good and kills himself. Spiderman 3.   Sand man and venom savagely demolishes pete. Harry beats sand castle. And helps helps fight Venom. Gets killed. Then pete plays bad music and kills venom and eddie. He does barely anything in those fights. With hardly any effort. Also. Just another thing. Tobys spiderman straight up murders people. He lets so many people die its unreal. Now are you gonna open your biased and ignorant mouth again and make me call you out for being stupid? Or are you gonna wise up and accept that cry baby emo parker isnt as great if a spiderman as you think?ï»¿"
"@Prince Darwin Seriously? Goblin turned his glider but Peter jumped and stabbed Norman instead, he DIDN'T kill himself because he wanted. With Ock he fought hard and did beat Otto in a fair battle, THEN he decides to end his life. And with Venom, Goblin did JACKSHIT. Harry threw Razor Bats at him but Venom absorbed them. Then he tries to stab him with his glider but he pushes him, causing his sacrifice. After that Peter fights in a 1 on 1 with Venom and beats him. Thanos, ha ha, Thanos vs Venom? I don't know, Venom can eat an entire person as shown in different comics, and can change his size, so he could eat Thanos' brain easily if he doesn't have the gauntlet. Talking about Thanos, Peter AND Ironman were taking off the gauntlet, Peter did nothing on his own. He didn't suffer at all, and if you say the ""I don't feel so good"" argument, well, Tobey Spidey was bleeding off both with Goblin and Venom, Sandman was crushing his skull and yet he holded on. And you didn't reply to my question, Â¿why is Peter a ""crybaby""?ï»¿"
@Colonel Mustard you need to go back to school. I cant understand a word you are sayingï»¿
"@Prince Darwin So now you are attacking me because I don't have good grammar? I'm pretty sure even a donkey can understand my statement. And in the extreme case I commited grammar errors, oh, God, sorry grammar officer, you changed my life, but I'm afraid you can't do jackshit about it because I'm chilean and english is not my first language.ï»¿"
let me just recap here. Read carefully. I said if you think |||||TOBYS SPIDERMAN||||| can fight thanos by himself you are biased and ignorant. And thanos would lay the floor with venom. He would crush him and erase him from existence. And did i say goblin killed himself willfully? No. I just said he killed himself. After he almost laid the floor with pete. And toms spiderman did suffer. He suffered through a lot in one movie. He almost died by drowning. He almost died by a giant lazer. All of His friends almost died. He saved thousands of people from a plane crash and survived said plane crash. He had a big building made of cement fall on top of him. And what happened after that? He pulled through and fought vulture and almost died. And he knew he was probably gonna die. But guess what? He kept pushing through with nothing but one of his web shooters. And after the fact he lost his love interest. You cannot say he has not struggled because that would be a lie. And yes. Tobys apiderman cries all the time. The only times he should've cried is when uncle ben and harry died. Thats it. Not every other second.  The only time tom cried is when a concrete building fell on top of him. And he had to find himself so he could muster up the courage to lift the building off of him. And harry did most of the heavy lifting in spiderman 3. HE was the one who beat sandman. HES the one who saved pete from them twice. If it werent for him pete would be dead. twice in the span of 3 or so minutes. He wouldve lost and died if harry didnt show upï»¿
@Colonel Mustard and the ock fight in s2 the way he won was mediocre at best. All he dud was repeatedly punch him in the face and electrocuted him. Thats all he did. That was hardly a fightï»¿
"@Prince Darwin That demonstrates Tobey Spidey has a brain and KNOWS how to use it. And I was talking about Venom eating Thanos without gauntlet, and Spidey did beat Venom, so you know the rest.ï»¿"
"@Prince Darwin Oh and you said Tom Spidey suffered because his friends ALMOST DIED, well I've got news, Tobey Spider-Man actually lost friends, like Harry, and in SM3 he knows the truth about his Uncle Ben which torments him through the full movie.ï»¿"

"Ok people stay with me here cause Iâ€™m gonna explain this to everyone who doesnâ€™t read the comics. (I donâ€™t  read the comics that much too, I just saw Ultimate Spider-Man, so any real comic fan who would like to help me get the facts right would be greatly appreciated) First: the spider-verse has been a thing for years. Second: the spider-verse is filled with many different iterations of the Spider-Man timeline. There is: Miles Morales (a black kid who got bit by the radioactive spider instead of Peter. He goes by the superhero name Spider-Man. Then we have Gwen Stacy who I think goes by the superhero name SpiderGwen. That is all I have for now. I could really need some help from people who actually reads the comics. Thanks in advance.ï»¿"
Princess Derpy of the muffin empire. Actually. It wasnâ€™t instead of Peter. They both got bit by a radioactive spider and Peter died so Miles took up the name Spider Manï»¿
Princess Derpy of the muffin empire. Thereâ€™s a LOT of alternate Spider-Man characters. It would take a long time to list them all.ï»¿
BlockSquad1000 just the ones in this trailer.ï»¿
"If I remember correctly,  Spider-Gwen was based off of a what if book where Gwen got bit by the radioactive spider instead of Peter. I remember this because my sister told me and bought the book.ï»¿"
"Princess Derpy of the muffin empire. Oh, okay. Well, you already know Miles and Gwen, but thereâ€™s also Spider-Ham (Who is from an alternate universe where the Marvel characters are all animals), Spider-Man Noir (From a universe that is set in the 1930s) and Sp//dr who is from an anime-inspired world (She controls a giant Spider-mech).ï»¿"
"@Terr!f!c Legend Peter didn't die, he's like the Green Goblin, the Oz thingy doesn't let them die.ï»¿"
Miles became spiderman after Peter died. Also spider gwen's comic is called spider gwen but really she's just a version of spider womanï»¿

@BlockSquad1000 I watched ultimate Spiderman so I know about Spider-Ham but didn't know anything else than the fact that he exists.ï»¿

Because they're from different universes.ï»¿
"Well, yeah but if that peter supposed to be the OG spidey then Gwen should be in that universe as well (well, ""had been"" cuz you know).

"Also to answer your question. I think it was to give her character some personality and edge.Trust me, I initially felt like they should have brought in the Marvel Mangaverse Peter Parker, who is like a Ninja Spider-Man with actual ninja equipment and a Ninja Clan. But the I also noticed that there are already 3 version of him. Regular Peter Parker, Noir Peter Parker, and Peter Porker. So yeah I think we have enough and could have other more unique iterations rather then just old Peter. Having Peni and giving her the anime makeover is an actual legitimately good compromise. Let's hope the movie will turn out okay.ï»¿"

"@Brendan MilburnYeah. I know that. And it looks natural in animations like ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"". But when i look at this trailer i can't stop thinking about that my ipad is broken.

"DÃ¶rmarochi More like Toadette--Oh wait.In all seriousness though, it's fine as a joke and all that, but it's the people who take it the next level that make me wanna stab people.

So Finally It's Arriveï»¿
black spiderman!ï»¿
That's comic styleï»¿
greatï»¿
logic-black spidermanï»¿
Spider man wearing nike shoes woow!!ï»¿
Oh no they spoiled too much I shouldn't have watched so many trailersï»¿
Looks stupidï»¿
"Am I seriously one of the only people that notices the low framerates? Don't get me wrong, the animation looks fantastic and I love the color and art style. But this trailer is straight up laggy. Idk if i would be able to watch a full length movie like that.ï»¿"
Pretty sure its on purpose... Makes it look like a comic bookï»¿
Brandon West the action scenes have more frames than the casual ones. Its a stylistic choice and I think it worksï»¿
"Obviously it's a design choice and they did it on purpose, I'm not disputing that.I just think it looks laggy in spots.If they can give the action scenes more frames then why not do the same for the casual scenes?In my opinion the low frames don't make the film look any more like a comic book, the art style and animations are what make it look that way.ï»¿"
"Brandon West it was simply done to save on time,effort and budget while looking good.ï»¿"
"@Keroikun Alright man, I'll take your word for it... I tried looking up the budget and found no info for that yet. It definitely saved time, no arguments there.I feel like not rushing it and having consistent frames across the board would make it look better, but that's just my opinion.It's going to look fantastic either way.ï»¿"
#Mhpspecial  #spiderverse #spiderman #spidermanps4 #spidermanmoviesï»¿
Just like the ultimate Spiderman TV series _Ÿ˜çï»¿
Miles Morales and Spider Gwen? Im sold :)ï»¿
Spider Noir: NO NO NOT THE SPIDERS!!!!!ï»¿
I WAS READYï»¿
"This looks extravagant! I would say this is worthy of a 3-D showing in my book! Idk about y'all, if you watch in 2D you are missing out on this glorious animation! And possibly very wicked 3-d effects for this one sorta like Incredibles 2!!!!I'm so hyped! Let's hope this movie can at least do well at the box office!!!ï»¿"
I'm a huge Spider-Man fan!!! Ever since I was three years old. Get all the 20 year olds and have an adult only showing. No little kids allowed!!ï»¿
"Black spider man and homosexual and trans, america great againï»¿"
What? What the hell you talking about? You sound like a crazy person.ï»¿
"Hm the first few trailers Iâ€™ve seen of this got me really excited for this movie but seeing so many spider people is kinda off putting.. like Iâ€™m 100% sure the pig is just going to be comedic relief. Idk in my opinion it wouldâ€™ve been cool just to stick with the three (og sm, Mikeâ€™s, and qwen) Iâ€™m still hype but idk _Ÿ_·â€çâ™€ï¸è hope itâ€™s better then I expectï»¿"
"Its also great that Spider Noir is less edgy graphic novel vigilante.and more Batman TAS or Adam West styled trench coat investigator that was also common for the era.ï»¿"
Nice trailerï»¿
Had to watch it three timesï»¿
this is a failï»¿
Scroll down the comment section and say that again with a straight faceï»¿
YoRHa No.2 Type B yes itâ€™s a failï»¿
"This looks good.But where is Toei Spiderman?ï»¿"
SUPAIDAMAN!ï»¿
CHANGE LEOPARDON!!!!!ï»¿
He will be the one to kill the villain in the ending with his giant robot.ï»¿
Still no stanly â˜_ï¸è_Ÿ™Åâ˜_ï¸èâ˜_ï¸è_Ÿ™Åâ˜_ï¸è_Ÿ™Å but I like the trailerï»¿
why do we need another spiderman???ï»¿
"What about Spider-Man 2099He was soooo coolï»¿"
I'm actually hype for this movie until they show a goddamn anime looking japanese spider girlï»¿
"Peni Parker (the ""anime Spider-Girl"") is an an established part of the Marvel Spider-Verse canon, and in this instance she is the Japanese representative of the Spider-verse in an animated movie. Why wouldn't they give her an anime gimmick? It'd have been a major missed opportunity if they didn't, and it just makes more sense then not (it also prevents her from just coming across like a generic gender-swapped-Asian-Spider-Man clone).ï»¿"
i actually did not care about this movie until they show a goddam spider loliï»¿
you complaining about Peni Parker but not Spider Ham??? the hell Leave our girl Peni Parker aloneï»¿
"Will there be more Spider-Men? Like Spider-Knight, Spider-Girl, Spider-Man 2099, or Scarlet Spider?ï»¿"
"There should be like 30 more spiders. Assassin spider man, spider girl from old man logan, superior spiderman, spider punk, spider cyborg, cosmic spider,  LOTS....ï»¿"
"I think there are more than enough already. The pacing might get clunky if they have to develop a whole bunch of spider people. Also, this is supposed to be a Miles movie, and it's already going to be hard to balance that with all of these other main characters.ï»¿"
I'm hoping to see those charactersï»¿
"Would be great if Doppelganger shows upHe's a multi armed evil Spider-Man.Man-Spider would be cool, he's a version of Peter who's more Spider then he is man.ï»¿"
I just want to see Supaidaman and the 60's Cartoon oneï»¿
@Shawn so Man-Spider is like Man-Batï»¿
They will never put 90s spider-man only 2000s spider-manï»¿
"@Matthew A.K.A GermanDogGaming basically yeah. But unlike man-bat who is Kirk Langstrom, Man-Spider was Peter after his ""mutation"" progressed. At least that's what I remember from the late 90's. Spider-Man the animated series.ï»¿"
"@Shawn wow thanks for the explanation,did you grew up from the comics.I grew up from the moviesï»¿"
"Next thing I know there will be crispy, roasted spidersï»¿"
"Don't forget the emmisary of hell himself, SUPAIDAMANï»¿"
"@Matthew A.K.A GermanDogGaming  TV animations in 80s & 90's when I was a kid/teenager.I read some comics, Spider-Ham as a real young kid, the first series from 1960's when I was a teenager and ""Ultimate Spider-Man"" series that started sometime around when the first movie came out. 2001 I think? That series is where Miles first appeared. I'm glad an older Peter is in this film to mentor him.ï»¿"
Trans spider is coming soon.ï»¿
@Shawn would be great if you guys did some research before saying stuff youre not even sure about. Doppelganger was created by the Magus in the Infinity War arc. He's not an alternate Peter Parker https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelganger_(comics)ï»¿
@Shawn no he's notï»¿
@Matthew A.K.A GermanDogGaming nopeï»¿
@Shawn there is a peter parker like that in the spiderverse comics but Doppelganger is an entirely separate character. He was more like an animal and Carnage and Shriek kept him as a petï»¿
"MY BOY JOHN MULANEY IS SPIDER-MANkind ofï»¿"
"anime spider girl is best spider girl _Ÿ˜çbut nah fr - the face of the second Spiderman to appear reminds me of someone....ï»¿"
Of course a BLACK spider man an AFRICAN AMERICAN. Man Venom is better then thisï»¿
"wow ekko got a suit, sickï»¿"
"WTF did they do to Gwen Stacy's hair?Did she join the marines and chicken out half way through the buzz cut?ï»¿"
in the movie apparently the Miles on her earth accidently sticks his hand on her hair and rips it offï»¿
Now this is one I wanna watch. Looks great.ï»¿
"They put in spider pigLmaoï»¿"
I mean how could they not? Spider-ham is awesome.ï»¿
Donâ€™t mess this up like The Emoji Movie.ï»¿
"Spider Gwen, this should be interesting_Ÿ˜…_Ÿ˜…ï»¿"
G-GWENNN!!!!! Don't remind me of Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield. âù__Ÿ˜çï»¿
It's awesome trailer but voice of real Peter is differentï»¿
Diggitï»¿
This looks so dope.ï»¿
Yaaaaaaaaaaaay Phil is BACK baby!!!!!ï»¿
"So Ultimate Peter Parker is like a celebrity superhero. Pretty popular, well off and well loved (mostly). Then Miles gets his powers, Ultimate PP dies, Kingpin creates his collider and 616-Peter arrives. He's the Spider-Man we know and love. Plucky, perpetually struggling to make ends meet, but the hero with the most solid moral core you'll meet. You can hear it in the tone of voice too. Ultimate Peter Parker sounds like a badass, gruff and tough. Our Peter Parker sounds like a loveable dork.ï»¿"

Such as a little keyboard keys and a computer mouse click here and there with the patient's info like NAME, DOB, & SSN = The list of ALL & EVERY SINGLE PERSON LISTED AS A REGISTERED CHILD ABUSER IN THE U.S.A.I Unfortunately Happened to be ENTERED AS ONE OF THEM By The Children's Protective Services Aka DSS/CPS back in 2014 when My Rights were Terminated, it wasn't until I gave birth to My 2nd child Aeriel Marie Heeschâ˜…Cons in April 20'16 that I figured something wasn't right because I was visited by 2 Social Workers from Escondido, CA San Diego County DSS / CPS & was told I tested positive for drugs which one of them was thee very drug I was administered by them which came out as an Opiate now I wondered how could this be when In Fact I was CLEAN & Sober, so there's no way I couldn't have there must have been a mistake and so I requested another take and Supposedly the test again came back the same, and was told I wasn't going to be allowed to leave and go home with my Newborn baby, that they were going to return with a warrant to remove her from my custody and that is exactly what they did with 2 police officers and at 2 days old My babygirl Aeriel was snached from my arms, after I left the hospital not too long after, on the way to our home all I kept thinking about was HOW IN THE . .. After being absolutely devastatingly heartbroken and crying my eyeballs out I took a moment to go through my Hospital paperwork and lo and behold , would you believe it that MY TEST RESULTS WERE ALL NEGATIVE Not Even A FALSE POSITIVE for Any & All Drugs tested for _Ÿ˜¡ so the next day when I was scheduled to see her for our first VISITATION date when I arrived I met with the temporary foster-care parent and couldn't hold my composure and just had to share the good news that I in fact was innocent of their fraudulent claims and insisted that she too relay the message to her as well as the rest of her colleagues also that I would be definitely SUEING THE HECK OUTTA THIER AGENCY FOR FALSIFIED INFORMATION TO REMOVE MY DAUGHTER, afterwards I'd say maybe a couple of hours while we were out shopping I get in the car and notice I got a Missed call and Received a VOICEMAIL MESSAGE and it was from the Social Worker letting us know their wasn't going to be a COURT HEARING any longer that it had been cancelled do to the fact we were CLEARED of ALL ALLEGATIONS only thing was that there still be an investigation period of just 30 days and Aeriel was READY TO BE PICKED UP AT ANY TIME TO GO HOME WITH US ASAP. You bet your ; We drove Soo darn fast to whatever daycare looking center place as I skipped and ran to retrieve My precious babygirl, it was Soo surreal it was unbelievably awesome to hear those words I thought I'd never hear but to _Ÿ˜çsee and feel her back in My arms MOMMA'S ARMS was simply AMAZING âù£ï¸è That is how I figured out their little scheme. _Ÿ_”ï»¿"
"Sorry,wtf is this?ni_Ÿ…±ï¸è_Ÿ…±ï¸èa man?ï»¿"
"Baby was NOT TAKEN BECAUSE OF DRUGS IN HIS SYSTEM NOR MINE OR ANY OF THAT SORT. The Reason as to WHY CPS WAS ALERTED BECAUSE WE SUPPOSEDLY ATTEMPTED TO FLEE THE HOSPITAL SO AS IT'S STATED ONTO THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS AND JUVENILE DEPENDENCY COURT REPORT PAPERWORK IT IS READ â€œExigent Circumstancesâ€ù is what thee Social Worker claims for The Removal of My newborn child without having an Warrant at the time he was taken into CFS/CPS Custody as use of forceful intimidation threats by an SAN BERNARDINO POLICE OFFICER as he and the CHILDREN'S FAMILY SERVICES Central Office in San Bernardino, California SOCIAL WORKER of San Bernardino County entered my Hospital Room while I was already being processed for DISCHARGE yet at the last minute we were kept waiting and finally since we weren't given a explaination as to why they all of a sudden were avoiding us so we just Decided to handle the matter the right way which is by LAW so in order to Protect My Family from any subjection of harm doing and malpractices from occurring as I've personally been subject to with past experience pertaining to another Hospital while being a patient there after delivery of another child of mine 2 years ago regarding a similar situation which I believe certainly was the wisest choice to have made as it is a CHOICE I HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO MAKE AND WOULDN'T YA KNOW IT IS STATED BY LAW AND PRINTED IN THEIR HOSPITAL'S NOTICE OF the Rules and Policies , Patient Rights and Responsibilities & Notice of Privacy Practices as a patient with Dignity Health Medical Foundation and that is I INFORMED THEM I NO LONGER WANTED TO BE KEPT AGAINST MY WILL WHEN I WAS ONLY JUST PATIENTLY WAITING FOR A SIMPLE PROCEDURE SUCH AS NO MORE THAN A COUPLE OF MINUTES TOPS MAX TO TAKE OFF MY BABY'S SECURITY ANKLET so I declared (AMA) Against Medical Advice just in case , and Refused any further Medical Attention or Service since there was no none such LEGIT APPARENT REASON for their actions & behavior for keeping us there but as you can see they did that Anyways. _Ÿ˜¡ï»¿"

"Thee following is audio and visual video footage inside My Hospital Room on the Maternity Ward floor level as We were actually in the process of being Discharged. As it begins with Myself as I am seen holding my newborn son and we figure something is not right so just to be safe and forget about two sides to every story, well here ya go; THEE TRUTH OF IT ALL AS IT REALLY HAPPENED FOR THE RECORD. Now you tell Me who should have to Explain themselves for their actions here as watch what is recorded by Jason D. Heesch, My fiancee' & thee Wonderful father of My Newborn Son. Thank God for this Man, had he not recorded It there wouldn't be any existing documentation of thee Ordeal nor would OuR Story probably be believable until you've witnessed This Video.!.?. This is actual proof of an Illegal Seizure when The Hospital (Dignity Health ST. BERNARDINE MEDICAL CENTER) where I delivered my son on July 12, 2018 @t 3:16am I  gave birth to My Newborn healthy 6 lbs 13 oz 18 inches beautiful babyboy, 24 hours after delivery as Both Mother & Baby were approved to be DISCHARGED, at the last minute Thee Nurses staff stalled Parents whom were unaware of being Reported to CPS, and were just patiently waiting for the removal of the infant's ankle monitor Security Band on his right foot. Nobody informed Neither Mother nor Father there was reason to Believe OuR child wouldn't  be safe with Us and so thee entire stay I was under thee impression all was good and well considering I was bonding (skin to skin) and caring for my newborn as thee natural Loving and nurturing mother I was reassured as I was being while My attending nurse constantly closely examined my interactions and attention level with assurance I was properly attending to my baby's needs, noone made no such mentionings of Concern as to why A REPORT WAS MADE AND NEVER DISCUSSION OF IT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION , UNFORTUNATELY no medical staff attempted to disclose any info as they unprofessionally improperly intervened my DISCHARGE in progress as We were LITERALLY ABOUT TO BE RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL TO GO HOME, But as soon as we were about to head out Seriously unbelievably the unimaginable occurred which 'THEY' USED AS AN EXCUSE TO KEEP US FROM GOING ANYWHERE ESPECIALLY ANYWHERE NEAR GOING TO HOME SWEET HOME so they Schemed Me and my newborn into confinement to My Hospital Room & unknowingly awaited the arrival of ONE Law Enforcement officer of San Bernardino Police Department , & 1 CPS SOCIAL WORKER FROM SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY (Central Office) CFS  CHILDREN'S FAMILY SERVICES in Cahoots with thisâ_•ï¸èMedical Kidnap_Ÿ†˜ & Didso WITHOUT A WARRANT âÅ‰ï¸èâù—THEY Violated My Rights !?!ï»¿"

"The animation is simply breathtaking, and the plot, though it seems a bit generic, appears to be superb in terms of execution. I am truly looking forward to this movie now!This movie seems very reminiscent of the Lego Movie, entertaining, self-aware, though it also contains a hint of the powerful thematic statements that made the Lego Movie such an excellent film. In addition, I just can't get enough of that artistic style, the way that this movie employs the colorful and cartoony animation, complete with visible sound effects, as if this film were directly converted from the pages of a comic. This film seems to know what it wants to be, and so far what I'm seeing is absolutely spectacular!Besides, I had to suppress a squeal when I saw the anime-style spiderman. The style just works so well, on every single freakin' character! God am I exhilarated!ï»¿"

Nice original comment you got thereï»¿
trailer was going good until they added animeï»¿
"Peni Parker (the ""anime Spider-Girl"") is the Japanese representative of the Spider-verse in an animated movie. Why wouldn't they give her an anime gimmick? It'd have been a major missed opportunity if they didn't, and it just makes more sense then not (it also prevents her from just coming across like a generic gender-swapped-Asian-Spider-Man clone).ï»¿"

Axel Arnal actually thatâ€™s not true at all. It was created by Insomniac for the game. Heâ€™s an alternate version of Peter Parker. The Insomniac version of Spider-Man is making an appearance in the Spider-Geddon comic book. But he was created for the game.ï»¿

Wait whatï»¿
Don't read too many comics so kinda confusing for meï»¿
"The Spiderverse, this is the event when many spiderman from across the multiple universes joining together to fight a common evil, this is the comic atleastï»¿"
"Siam Kabir basically, there are a bunch of different spider-themed heroes in Marvel comics. Most of them never met. However, there was a big event where they all met. All of them. If you could slap the word Spider on it, it was a version of spider-man and it was there. I donâ€™t know if any of this helps ease the confusion, but thatâ€™s the shortest possible explanation.ï»¿"
"Just go with the  flow, it was kind of a mess in the comics so let's hope this wont be.ï»¿"
"Okay, so, first, there are multiple ""universes"" in the comic books where you have the same people but things happen to them just a bit differently and they have different continuities. The main Marvel universe is known as 616. About 20 years ago, they introduced a second one known as the Ultimate universe which is where Miles comes from - he replaced Peter after Ultimate Peter died. A third universe is the Marvel Cinematic Universe (which is kind of mish mash of 616, Ultimate, and original elements). Every time a character gets a new continuity, it gets a new universe. There's a zombie universe, a manga universe, if you're a reader of the daily, Spider-Man newspaper strips, that's a universe. All of the cartoons get their own universes. The live action 1970's TV show. The live action 1970's JAPANESE TV show. Spider-Man: Turn Off The Dark. All in different Marvel universes.A few years back, they did an event where all of the Spider-People meet each other in order to fight a Big Bad. On top of the above universes, they also invented a few new Spider-People. Spider-Man Noir, Peni with her robot, and most famously Spider-Woman who is known amongst the fan base as Spider-Gwen (and is in the middle of a rename to Ghost Spider??). In her universe, instead of being Peter's tragically murdered girlfriend, she got bit by the radioactive spider, Peter started experimenting on himself to turn himself into The Lizard, and Peter ended up becoming Gwen's tragically dead boyfriend, instead.ï»¿"

Radical Butters doesnâ€™t mean it didnâ€™t happen in the movies too. Itâ€™s still plausibleï»¿
Most probably that the Spider-Man of that universe shares events from the Sam Raimi films but are slightly different like the train for instance where he's still got his mask on.ï»¿
But he wasn't wearing his spidersuit when the car crashed through the window in Tobey's version. Nor did he punch it. If anything it proves that it's not following those movies.ï»¿

"Bro, I'm as against SJW culture as you can get and this movie looks amazing. I was sceptical at first, but if this trailer is anything to go by this is gonna be one heck of a hilarious, wild wide. Loving the different versions of the character, all totally different. Your typical Peter Parker, a young Spider-Man of colour (Miles Morales), a lady Spider-Woman (Spider-Gwen), a Japanese anime Spider-Girl (Peni Parker) and a Spider pig (Spider-Ham). I don't like when there's forced diversity in something but this isn't ""forced diversity"", and if you think it is you're just an idiot. When something is good it's good regardless of the diversity of the cast. Just because there's a black Spider-Man and two female Spider-People it doesn't make it an SJW move. The two male Spider-Men meeting a Gwen who became Spider-Woman as well as a ""loli"" anime schoolgirl who became her version of Spider-Man is a great concept with a lot of potential for interesting and funny interaction. And the comedic opportunities for all of them meeting a pig version of Spider-Man basically write themselves. Don't write something off just because it happens to have a few females in it, or a character who isn't American or white. That's just as ignorant, if not more so, then the SJWs that you dislike.ï»¿"

"Shame they didn't spring for 25 frames per second. The jerkiness from watching the trailers is distracting enough I don't know how I'll do with a full film. Cheap, Sony, cheap...ï»¿"
https://youtu.be/Fm5WvAG5Mrcï»¿
"I think it was an artistic choice rather than them just being cheap, i mean, they're not a small company and can afford to make it look smooth.ï»¿"
"That's entirely plausible and my opinion, like all others, is subjective. But that you used the word 'smooth' to describe what the animation isn't speaks volumes. Sony have had their fingers burned by Spider-Man before by over-reaching, perhaps they've deliberately scaled back their investment here to see how it does, going for the anti-smooth level of animation.Perhaps they are trying to harken to a time of more primitive, hand-drawn animation? But this is a world of Disney/Pixar, Illumination, Blue Sky, even Sony Animation and they all do 24+fps for a reason.The trailer has the feel of something which was meant for straight-to-DVD, I would like something which was meant for the big screen.ï»¿"
"Speaking as someone in the animation industry, what you are seeing is what is commonly referred to as animating on two's. It's 100% an aesthetic choice and comes with its own challenges and limitations. Basically they key animation on every second frame and mimics stop motion animation, the real reason why I think they did it is because animating on two's allows for really snappy awesome action animation where the character snaps from pose to pose. This also makes sense with the fact that they are trying to make it look as much like a comic book as possible. Spiderman is known for his iconic and dynamic poses. Animating him on ones or ""smoother"" would sacrifice the snappy iconic poses for fluidity. Some people would prefer the fluidity over a more stylized look but it comes down to taste. But it's intentional and doesn't really reduce cost much at all.Again up to taste.ï»¿"

"@kizmazter123 true but there were so many tho like the train scene, the kissing MJ scene and even tho that scene might be a lil different it's still v similar also there was a small glimpse of him fighting doc ock, but yeah either way both much appreciated whether it's just Easter eggs or actually Tobeys versionï»¿"

"Peni Parker (the ""anime Spider-Girl"") is the Japanese representative of the Spider-verse in an animated movie. Why wouldn't they give her an anime gimmick?

"This looks amazing! But Iâ€™m wondering who the anime one is, because Iâ€™ve never seen her beforeï»¿"
Peni Parkerï»¿
"What I love is the contrast of stylesSpider Ham moves like a classic looney tunes cartoon character The anime girl Peni is overly cutesy and looks as flat straight out of a manga or animeAnd spider noir looks like heâ€™s straight out of a newspaper, right down to the fact that heâ€™s still black white and grayï»¿"

OMG! Homer's SpiderPig is real!!ï»¿
I think this is it chiefï»¿
â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…ï»¿
"Is there actually a version of Spiderman that's a little weeb girl with a bot in the comics? Cuz that's awesome.ï»¿"
Yep!ï»¿
"Go read Spider-verse (the comic) and its tie-ins. That's where they introduced Peni Parker and Spider-Gwen alongside many others like Spider-Punk, Lady Spider and a Uncle Ben Spider-man. There's even a part where the Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield Spider-man were mentioned. Not to mention, the story also brought in one of my favorites: A Japanese Spider-man who pilots a giant mech named Leopardon from a 1970s tokusatsu show from Toei. Because of this particular Spider-man, Power Rangers (or Super Sentai) now has their Megazords.ï»¿"
What if the peter Parker we get in miles universe is Tom Hollandï»¿
I wish that Tobey was one of the voice actors would've made my life complete.ï»¿
Xofficialjzm could be old spider man.ï»¿
It's entirely possible that Tobey Maguire's Spiderman will show up in the movie.ï»¿
i think that version of peter parker could be based on tobey.  theres a scene in the trailer where hes looking at Mjâ€™s photo.  from the universe hes from maybe pete is spiderman still and married to Mj.ï»¿
It wouldn't have been as fun.ï»¿
Tobeys Spider Man is a drag.ï»¿

Black Spiderman? Okay... Isn't Spiderman supposed to stop crime though?ï»¿
"Anyone else wish this was live action and not animated, or at least a different style of animation?ï»¿"

What makes it political? The fact that Miles Morales is in it?ï»¿
"@Das It Mane yeah I didn't know that was a thing, just thought they turned Spiderman black, like a few other cast decisions throughout films. It is a little niche to begin with.ï»¿"
Miles Morales has been in Ultimate Spiderman for years. This isnt new and this story has been sort of done in the comics as wellï»¿

Two completely different films. Nice try starting flame war in comments. Dickheadï»¿
"EASILY..... matter of fact, this is the best comic book movie trailer since Infinity War ( Antman and Wasp was ok, but this is better). I had ZERO faith in this... Now I'm hyped for it. Good trailer.ï»¿"
But they just explained the entire plot....ï»¿
12fps??? _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
I recognize all but the little girl. Who is she?ï»¿
Peni Parkerï»¿
Sheâ€™s from a Japense Manga. She controls the Spider-Mech. Also named Peni Parkerï»¿
This opens the door to so many more animated AAA filmsï»¿
AAA films?ï»¿
you don't get AAA filmsï»¿
@Fumb dumb you know how video games are categorized in budget by AA and AAA? That's what they're talking about.ï»¿
@Fumb dumb he means as in super high budget high quality animated moviesï»¿
"@Roberto Horacio De Lugo films don't get categorised like that. Also there are lots of high budget animated films by Disney/DreamWorks , his comment doesn't really make any sense.ï»¿"
"@Fumb dumb I think what he means is, not many popular or deserving characters get high budget animated movies. So if this is successful, we might get more mainstream animated movies of popular characters.ï»¿"

Grant S He was canon before he was in Simpson. He's been around since the 80s.ï»¿

What if the Peter Parker in this is a secret continuation of the Tobey Maguire spiderman. It does show famouse scenes from the trilogy in this trailer in animation form and it would make sense if they wanted to give him a real ending.

So I found a few things wrong with this trailer alreadyï»¿

Just imagine if Spider-Man form our universe was somehow Tom Hollandâ€™s Spider-Man from the MCU?ï»¿
"MTG Legos and Gaming This movie isn't connected to the MCU, and Tom Holland will have a 0% chance of having a cameo.ï»¿"

Haha it's spiderpig from the Simpson's universeï»¿
Nope. Spider Ham is from a universd were everybody are animalsï»¿
@G-Luke yes finally someone got it rightï»¿
Spider-Ham has been around since many years before that one Simpson's joke.  Years of comic book history forgotten because some film makes a dumb joke that vaguely resembles the main character.ï»¿
Nah guys Simpson's did it before everyone.ï»¿
"@Ricky Camacho, nope.  Spider-Ham first appeared in 1983.  The first episode of SImpson's was 6 years later in 1989, and the Simpson's film, which is where the Spider-Pig song comes from was in 2007, a full 24 years after Spider-Ham. So, no, Spider-Ham was first by 24 years.ï»¿"

Why are there so many missing frames it makes it hard to watch and gives the impression that its animated worse than claymation. I shouldnt look at Jason and the Argonaughts and think that has smoother animation than a 2018 studio made movie. It could be done better in Blender on a decent rig.ï»¿

"Spider-Man doesn't need an R-rating, unless it's adapting Carnage (and even then, it's only R because of how disturbing/violent Carnage, not because they're having Spider-Man swear up a storm). Venom should only be R if he's on his own, if he's just a villain in a Spider-Man movie, then it should be fine as PG-13.ï»¿"

Yes but Sony was in charge of the marketing on that. They have a joint production deal on Spider-Man solo filmsï»¿
The movie is called into the spider-verse so I don't think they're really spoiling the plot just spoiling which spider people are gonna be in the movieï»¿
Yeah I hope they don't spoil much for Spiderman: Far from Home.ï»¿
"@Darceus what? Marvel is pretty bad at this too! Especially in Thor Ragnarok it was awful. Ive honestly stopped watching the 2. Trailers, because they are always full of spoilers.ï»¿"
"I feel like there's still plenty that can go on in this film that isn't shown in the trailer, leaving us with just enough surprise in the theater. Also, let's be honest, as long as the presentation is on point, it doesn't matter how much of the plot is given away in the trailer. Case in point: every movie ever made based on a book.P.S. I just love how they incorporate the dot-matrix coloring style. This looks visually stunning. Can't wait to watch it in theaters.ï»¿"
Wait so what did they spoil? The characters cuz we alr knew them. The villains? Cuz it's essentially what you expect which is the ultimate universe version of the spiderman rogues gallery. Or is it the plot? Because this is a comic book adaptation movie of the spiderverse comic and we alr kinda know the plot alr. So I don't see your complaintï»¿

"black ironman black captain marvel black captain americathen Black spiderman.............ï»¿"
sevenlift Itâ€™s Miles Morales.ï»¿
Racist white person who is threatened by a story ark that is 10 years old? Lolï»¿
"Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Carol Danvers and Peter Parker are still white... multiple people can be the same superhero. There are multiple Flashes, multiple Green Lanterns (one is black), multiple Blue Beetles etc.ï»¿"
"White people: â€œWe do not have a race problemâ€ù Sees Black people as main characters Also White people: â€œwhy are they black? What is this bullshitâ€ù? Yep. Definitely no race problem at ALLï»¿"
sevenlift miles has been a thing in the comics for years now. He isnâ€™t new.ï»¿
"alsofalcon has been a thing for a while, he just took the mantle of Captain AmericaMs Marvel (Kamala Khan) is not black, but racists be racists i guessï»¿"
Miles Morales has been around forever ya fuckin wadï»¿
"EH Miguel You know, I just realized almost always, blacks are sidekicks for superheroesIron man-War MachineCaptain America-FalconCaptain Marvel-Monica RambeauFlash-(I donâ€™t know the name of him)Green Lantern-(I donâ€™t know name of him also)ï»¿"

No this is an entirely different plotline more likely based on the Spider-Verse comics.ï»¿
"@Cristiano Ronaldo i agree with you there tbh. His Spiderman was decent, his Peter was Trash. He was too cool, hence completely out of character.ï»¿"
Finley Simmons lol no. Try again kid. Maguire was trashï»¿
@Ant P You can't tell me Maguire was trash and Garfield wasn't. I'm not even going to bother arguing with someone who has the collective IQ of a cabbage if that's what you think.ï»¿

"And its not just standard 2D animation either, its super stylized and I love the experimentation with it.ï»¿"
It's actually an animation made to render as cartoon art (it allows for more stuff to be done and is probs a lil cheaper and faster)ï»¿

You mean...not a weaboo anime cringefestï»¿
It's combination of 2D and 3Dï»¿
Dude this is full computer animation. But they use special shaders to make it look like 2D animation. It looks very good tho. Something different than the nice smooth Pixar animation look that dominates the market. Not sure about the cut frames technique they use to make it more look like a classic 2d animation. It kinda annoyed me a but but it is probably better when we get longer camera sequences instead of short jumpcut trailer sequences.ï»¿
"@B D exactly, don't get his comment...if u ask me I don't like how it's choppy on purpose...I think it animating more fluid would have been better, they even voice it like yor typical slick and fast cg movie, making that stand out me more...oh wellï»¿"

Sjw garbage. Create new characters and stop destroying the core characters that made you successful in the first place. Blue marvel is awrsome. Didnt have to turn thor into a philipino guy to do it. Create new characters.ï»¿
kingogkingswoodz new characters? Who?ï»¿
None of these characters are newï»¿
Lmfao do you seriously not know who these characters are? Miles Morales has been spider man since like what 2011? And he was first thought of and created in 2008. Literally none of these characters are new _Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ these are all original comic book charactersï»¿
@NotMyPresident President lol so yes last ten yrs or less is called new. Sorry kiddo but I'd guess your a tween at best if not younger.ï»¿

"This guy was probably still finishing school when Miles Morales first appeared in Marvel lmfao. Peter Parker is still white as snow, don't worry. Did people complain when they replaced Hal Jordan and Guy Gardener with John Stewart?ï»¿"
"What most white peoples donâ€™t realize, is that anyone White, Black, Mexican, can be spider man, but only a white dude can be Parker.

1:39 did you guys saw the Advanced suit from Spider-Man ps4 behind Aunt Mayï»¿
that is really the insomniac spider suit from spiderman ps4ï»¿
So I guess the rumours are true it is connected to the mcu!ï»¿
Mitchell Reilly not really. The insomniac game is just another Spider-Man from a different universe like all of them hereï»¿
@Mmm Ghool but the way there going with it is that its Spider-Man's suits and hideout so possibly it might be the same peter just in the future.ï»¿
"Mitchell Reilly wrong. Itâ€™s just because in the multiverse movie Thereâ€™s probably This Peter we see who Iâ€™d assume is Tobyâ€™s Spider-Man with that train scene, then Spider-Man PS4 with the advanced suit, and maybe even tom Hollandâ€™s and Garfieldâ€™s. I doubt this is connected to the MCU but just throws Easter eggs to all the Spider-Man weâ€™ve had threw the years.ï»¿"
"Considering there's currently an ongoing comic called Spider-geddon (a sequel to the Spider-verse comic where the multiverse Spideys fought Morlun and the Inheritors), I wonder if this movie has any connection to the comic series, especially seeing that the PS4 Spidey is part of Spider-ggedon.ï»¿"
@KrystCyclone spidey ps4 is part of spider-geddon he is a main character so I'm hyped for that comic hope you are to now!ï»¿
@Dylan Vincent well you dont know that it could be anything. It might even be all four of those spidey's into one for this movie. So just because we see those suits and scenes doesn't mean it's one character. It is a spider-verse after all.ï»¿

"Animation is definitely the way to go for Spider-verse. I mean, look at how it managed to put in these different Spider-men together while incorporating their respective styles. The cartoony Spider-Ham, the 1940s look of Noir (look closely at the model, the texture is something like from an old comic) and the anime inspired Peni Parker.ï»¿"

"Peter Porker, ya mean.ï»¿"
"Also makes sense that Gwen and Peter are very similar in style, since they are basically all in the same universe per se (Gwen is basically where Peter is not bitten and she is, and Miles is the protege of Peter, so just different timelines and such)ï»¿"

So just because it's animated means it won't be worth a watch? Dude You need to give this a try sure they could've made a live action film but with animation you have no limits on what you can do. So just because it's animated isn't really a good reason to not see this.ï»¿

The animation is just plain beautiful!ï»¿
So beautiful!ï»¿
the style is beautiful the animation is choppy and painful to watch.ï»¿
PheonixKnght noï»¿
"@PheonixKnght It's an artistic choice to give the movie a stop motion feel to really sell the comic book look (as it reflects the choppiness of jumping from panel to panel).ï»¿"
I know they chose to do it but its a bad choice.  Like Dragon Prince the choppiness makes it hard to watch which is a shame since the style is amazing. It reminds me of bad claymation movies. Lower frames on CG movies is a way they can cut the render time to a third of what it would be but just comes off as cheap and ugly.ï»¿
"@PheonixKnght Agreed, the art style looks amazing, yet like you said the animation is choppy. But I'm pretty sure they aimed for that.ï»¿"
"Well i see what you're saying but your wrong. This style and animation is a great choice, I just dont see the bad in this. The look of the characters are great the look of it being a comic is great as well. Also you seem to be saying its bad, do you mean The Amazing Spider-Man movies bad or some idiot who thinks Spider-man is bad.ï»¿"
"Well if this is what Marvel is going to do with their animated movies then ill never see any of them. My friends dont like the choppy animation either and will not see it because of the choppy animation so that is eight people off the top of my head that wont see it for this one reason alone. I know it is what they are shooting for but it hurts to watch and i will not watch any movies or shows that do this just like Dragon Prince. I called netflix over the choppiness of that and sent a bug report on it along with voting it down because of the bad animation. That is a show i have been excited about since i heard who was making it but now i wont watch it i would rather read it on a wiki page.Silverboy2 what im saying is all of this looks great but the choppiness of the animation. If they gave it more FPS i would love it and go to see it maybe many times.ï»¿"

Okay dont get me wrong im still super stoked for this film and im glad that Noir is getting some more mainstream recognition but can we please just get an accurate representation for once.

â„¢Black Panther changed the game â€_ï¸è_Ÿ’ª_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ_™ï»¿
How?ï»¿
Can you please explain how it changed the game.ï»¿
No it didn'tï»¿
Black panther showed big studios proof that they culd invest in more black lead characters films and get a return why is this  news why tf do you think black panther was such an important film it wasnt cause the hero was black its already been done blade played by wesley snipes were good movies but studios always had their reservations and didnt invest nearly as much as they did compared to bp the movie's success opened doors and is continuing to open doors for up and coming young black actors in hollywood. It was the highest big budget film with an all black cast marvel studio had taken a chance investing that type of money. It doing so well proved that studio need to no longer  worrry about how others audiences would react to the racial demographic of the film it proved the movie wuld be judged on its  content not race ?ï»¿
@Djoseph11230 Do you think that Black Panther being part of the MCU had any effect on it's success?ï»¿
@Djoseph11230 You ever hear of I am legend?ï»¿
@Djoseph11230 just because the cast is all black doesn't matter. In the film industry no one should care about race. You should care about merit or who's best for the job. Not their skin colour because that's also racist.ï»¿
"@Sanji Dandelion  bro wil smith was already an established actor long before he was on the big screen he was already know second they were NOT all black casted films and third bp was backed by a Major studio disney, marvel house hold names tell me one of the names of the studios that produced any of the film will smith was in as a lead charactorDont worry ill wait and dont use google either name one from the top of your headï»¿"
"@Zero Cool No if audiences cared about race they wuldnt watch a all black film becuase marvels sticker is on it plus films dont make a 1 billion dollars by having a popular studio behind it also needs word of mouth. Thats the reason it outsold all of marvels others film accept 1st avengers. black panther surpassing all of robert downys ironman films had nothing to do with marvels backing it was the content and thats what movies should be judged on. If only black peeple in the u.s showee up to watch i guarantee it wouldnt even make the 100 mil mark were 14% of the population meaning other people were not only willing to give it a chance but liked it so much that they told there friends and family to go see it. Thats how 1 billion is made or should i say 1.4 billionPlus the studio purposly avoided casting any characters from previous marvel films in bp becuase they wanted it to stand on its own merrits. Samuel jackson had begged marvel to let him be in the movie a cameo anything since it was clearly a black superhero film  and he was already part of the mcu they still told him no . Dont belive me look up his interviewï»¿"
"Djoseph11230 are you dumb? Miles has been known to be one of the most loved charectors  not mainstreamingly known, I mean all fans of the Spiderman comics have basically just Ben waiting for a Miles film. spoiler for comics Also in the MCU miles replaced Spiderman after he dies cough cough I don't feel so goodï»¿"
@Sanji Dandelion Ok.ï»¿
@Sanji Dandelion bro i agree but tell that to the studios their the ones who decide what we watch its their money films making is a business and investors expect a return studios are not in the buisness of making political statment  just money.

However, you claiming  ""I know we all know these characters have existed for like ever"" miles hasn't even been around for 7 years and he was pretty much entirely made because of the whole agenda. Spider-gwen started in 2015 and made her bi/lesbian for that agenda. So, no not really.  Doesn't mean this will be bad though. I'm looking forward to it.ï»¿"

"@taciturasa crying more like all the people clamoring for their representation until the point that this stuff has been beaten to death that now they add a black or gay character into literally every form of media and if they don't they are prejudice/misogynist/racist  and hate that community?  That now netflix always tries to have a black /gay character as a focus because if not, people will cry about not being  represented in literally everything? They are replacing ciri (witcher netflix series) with literally any race that isn't white and making her a lead character just for that reason. I'm not saying they shouldn't be represented at all, but it's gotten to crazy heights the past few years that it's almost a sin to have a straight couple in a lot of it and they might as well be asexual.ï»¿"
"you're constructing completely fictional oppositional statements, Zyler, in response to some minorities existing in media, Zyler. we're out here running the risk of being killed for our mere existence, Zyler. cry more.ï»¿"

what the heck? Running the risk of being killed for your mere existence? like everyone else?  so freaking hyperbolic.  Are you meaning the massively high suicide rate for the mentally unstable? and some existence? it's quite actively a huge part of what's going on that it's literally in every form of media.ï»¿
"@radah25 I'm not saying they've had no representation or don't need to exist in media of course, I just mean that it's quite actively everywhere in tons of stuff now and in nearly everything. There's no problem with being represented, of course.  Just saying they are trying to do it for the sake of the race / attention not just making it a sub plot. like when you try to hire someone that is of a specific race and purposefully excluding others, imo, that's a problem to me.  Miles morales is a pretty good character all in all.  A good form of the diversity. and Gold dust isn't transgender? Just was flamboyant really. She-ra wasn't bad though.ï»¿"

"@Layiah Ali You need to compartmentalize your argument because it's all over the place similar to a noob playing a fps who sprays bullets hoping to get a hit.- Just like you said in your own words:""Fans of color wanted someone who they can relate to""  Well if that's not being inclusive to appease certain people then you don't know what pc and affirmative action is.- Peter Parker is presented in this trailer as being jaded and unappealing with a cloud of despair to contrast Mile's enthusiasm, curiosity and vitality.- I'm definitely not watching this SJW nonsense like Star Wars The Last Jedi. No thanks- Anyone who thinks pandering to appeal to certain groups is acceptable is an idiot. Why do you think Black Panther was a huge hit? It wasn't because he was  just black. He was an original not a black version of somebody who's already established.- The White Knights have arrived. Beta males seem to congregate near women they forsee could use help when they actually don't making them a nuisance.ï»¿"

"Miles is a already established character in the comics. Also this movie does feature Peter, so don't worry. Even is it didn't, you still have the MCU version of Spidey.ï»¿"
They really going to put Miles morales as Spider man. You know what I'm talking about if you saw the ending of Spider man ps4ï»¿
Just Christmas wtf?ï»¿
Love the style and comic book type of animation.ï»¿
Theyâ€™re getting ready to black wash all of our white heroes.ï»¿
Who cares!!! It not like being white is a big part of Spider-Man's character. Plus Peter is in this movie too.ï»¿

probably the best trailer ive ever seenï»¿
OH MY GODS THIS IS SO PERFECTï»¿
Spider-Noir seems like a bad idea since Iâ€™m pretty sure he kills people. He also has a gun which I donâ€™t think will go over well with the others so he prob wonâ€™t even have it in the movieï»¿
"All the spider-(men?,people) are actually really different from what they are,miles in this movie is really different same with just OG Spider-Man and Gwenâ€™s looks,Also they added a new anime......person so everything in this movie is pretty much slightly different versions from Spider-Man comicsï»¿"

Wait its a movie? Thought i was a gameï»¿
Well technically It created by Sony Pictures Animation (sony still has the rights to Spiderman films)...Marvel doesn't have Animation Division for theatrical films...maybe marvel act as the manager of the source material and also as a consultant...ï»¿

ELITEKILLERZZ YT where ?ï»¿
@strikey the first few seconds of the trailer. Where he stops the train and kisses Mary Jane upside down. Those were references to the first Spider-Man movieï»¿
I think heâ€™s referring to when the og Spider-Man said â€œmy name is peter Parkerâ€ù and the clips of him stopping the train and kissing mjï»¿
ELITEKILLERZZ YT Tobey Maguire sucks. Just because you were a kid when the movies came out doesnâ€™t mean they were good.ï»¿
"@TomTheTrain that makes no sense, that's his/her opinion.ï»¿"
I doï»¿
"@TomTheTrain theyre good bc sam raimi made them good, look up ""opinion"" in the dictionary and write me a lil report on what it meansï»¿"
Of course its also a Sonyï»¿
TomTheTrain you probably think Tom Holland is the best Spider Manï»¿
TomTheTrain Spider-Man 2 is still the best Spider-Manï»¿
"TomTheTrain I mean, you play roblox.ï»¿"
"TomTheTrain It's not because we was kids when it came out, it's because they were amazing. But you wouldn't know that cause you were still swimming around in your dads balls while we were watching the best spiderman movies that was ever made.ï»¿"
TomTheTrain You obviously never watch the Sam Rami Spiderman films. Have you even check the reviews it receive?ï»¿
@Buga Voorhees Tom Holland IS the best spiderman. Wait for his other 2 movies.ï»¿
Lil LoudPakk just bc he was portrayed as the most accurate Spider Man/Peter Parker doesnâ€™t mean heâ€™s the best one. Homecoming doesnâ€™t compare to Spider Man 2.ï»¿
"And the car scene, and the dr octopusï»¿"
Still the one and only spider manï»¿
@Buga Voorhees uhh..yes it does mean he's the best spiderman if he really portrays the most accurate version of him how is that even a argument that's like going against your own opinion_Ÿ˜‚_Ÿ˜‚ that was a contradiction how you gonna say hes the most accurate then say he isn't the best one?ï»¿
"I kinda disagree with Tobey Mcguire's Spiderman being the ""most accurate"". I do agree that his ""Peter Parker"" was the most accurate but not his ""Spiderman"". I actually felt Andrew Garfield's Spiderman was more accurate but his Peter Parker wasn't. I personally like Tom Holland best because it's a happy mediumï»¿"
This trailer just blow my mind.ï»¿
"Spiderman: If I don't destroy this collider, None of us will have a home to go home to""(1:58)ï»¿"

He's a decent character, but I feel pandered to whenever a minority assumes the title of a non-minority character without compelling reason. Again, Miles is still leagues better than most. I'd argue his existence is far more justifiable. I just never got into him really because I see myself more in Peter.ï»¿"

"Agreed. There's been too many Parkers on the silver screen. Seeing a live-action depiction of Miles with his suit would have been neat. Because so far the best Peter Parker has been Tobey Maguire.

Wtf a black spidermanï»¿
Not sure if you guys noticed but Spider-Ham is John Mulaney.ï»¿
I usually hate Marvel but the only thing I like is Spider-Man because heâ€™s original. Marvel didnâ€™t copy him from dc. Heâ€™s a true hearted character and heâ€™s also the first youngest comic book superhero back in the 50â€™s. Such a awesome character. Much love for this movie :)))ï»¿
But spider-man wasn't created till the 60's and there were other younger super heroes that pre-date him like Robin and Captain Marvel/Shazam that came out in the 40'sï»¿
Matt Zeilmann oh sorry my bad 60â€™s* and really? Iâ€™ve read a dozen times that Spider-Man is the first youngest superhero from the comics. Shazam is kinda complicated since itâ€™s a kid that turns into a grown man but thatâ€™s a good pointï»¿
"@Shady Kermit I would he was probably the first to be a young superhero and actually have it mean something. Like Robin was a kid but never really acted like one, he would never really go to school or have a life outside of being a superhero unlike spiderman he was probably the first where being so young actually meant  something.ï»¿"

"ApexKnight No it doesntï»¿"
"@VenomIsSoCute Yeah It does. Peter Parker and his alternate versions all fall into Miles universe and they have to work together to destroy the collider while also teaching Miles how to be spiderman. 10 bucks that scene when he talks to his dad as spiderman is at the very end. I'm still gonna see this movie, but whoever put this trailer together is a fool.ï»¿"

What happened to Tom Holland-ï»¿

At least he has a dad....the other one canâ€™t even keep his uncleï»¿
I literally donâ€™t think I could be more excited for this movie. Christmas canâ€™t get here fast enough! The only thing that could make this movie better is if Spider-man 2099 was in it. But the cast as it is rn is still fantastic. Plus we have Nick Cage voicing Spider-man Noir...simply amazing.ï»¿

"INSANE Nero Thatâ€™s still too long, I need this movie nowï»¿"

"So you ""literally"" don't think you can think something?Stop saying ""literally"" for emphasis just because you hear other people do it.It makes you sound literally stupid.ï»¿"
I'm hopeful we see more Spider-Men and that they're keeping them as a surprise for the movieï»¿
"TemGoBoom Yeah, I really hope this movie does well enough to justify a sequel. Would love to see a rotating cast of all the the different Spider-men in each of the possible sequels, possibly keeping Miles, or even Spider-Gwen, as the â€˜mainâ€™ characters in each movie.ï»¿"
"Manuel David Rendon Acevedo Maybe, but if they introduce more Spider-men they run the risk of bloating the cast and having too many characters. I think itâ€™d be smarter if they saved more Spider-men for any possible sequels, maybe tease them in this movie, but the six we have rn are great and diverse. I want to see as many Spider-men as possible, trust me, but I donâ€™t want the movie to be â€˜overcrowdedâ€™ either.ï»¿"
I only came here for Nic Cageï»¿

I love how they break the 4rth wall in this movie and just make fun of how many spider men there areï»¿
NIKE Advertising their Shoes at 2:40 at least it isn't as bad as the Bud Light Advertising scene in Transformers the Last Knight. lolz!!!ï»¿
Do you think I'll like this movie even though I've never once opened a comic book?ï»¿
Yeah looks pretty accessibleï»¿
Is that the spider pig joke from the simpsons movie or is there really a spider pig from one of the comic universe? Man i need to brush up on my spiderman knowledgeï»¿
There is really a Spider Ham in the cannon marvel universeï»¿
Yeah he is from the comics from a universe where essentially every Marvel character is a Looney Toonï»¿
"This is kinda the problem with introducing multiple dimensions in marvel's superhero films. The average movie-going audience doesn't understand what's going on when they have characters as absurdist as ""SpiderHam."" This concept should have been eased into instead of throwing the audience headfirst into the idea of parallel universes with multiple spidermen. It's going to be confusing for people who aren't as familiar with that concept.ï»¿"
Not to say this movie is going to be bad at all. It looks pretty good at the moment. Loving the little references. Just hoping it makes sense from a story telling perspective. Here's to being hopeful.ï»¿
Yep there's a Spider-Ham in the comics and his real name is Peter Porker.ï»¿
Iqbal Satrio Nindito Spider Ham is in fact a Canon spiderï»¿
Best part is Spiderham is played by John Mulaneyï»¿
"Good lord, he is actually canon indeed! I actually googled him and found the story and his universe (captain americat, lol) interesting indeed. I reckon this movie will be just fine, sure some light fan like myself will need to google the reference every now and then, but hey, the more the people will know about Spiderman universe the better!ï»¿"
"Spider-Ham is canon and was created in the 1980s. In his universe, all the heroes are animals. Peter Porker is pretty funny.ï»¿"
"Iqbal Satrio Nindito Tbh I think the strangest is Peni Parker and SP//dr, the little girl and giant mech she controls with her mindï»¿"
since heâ€™s stuck in another dimension...i guess heâ€™s Spider-Man: Far from Home...eh? EH?ï»¿

"Eh, not even Minions deserve that kind of comparison with the Emoji Movie. The latter really is just a special kind of dreadful from Sony. Even to the point where other movies like Cars 2, Chicken Little, and Shark Tale are starting to look a whole lot better by contrast. I do have more hope in this movie than Venom though and this movie could only be their potential fluke.ï»¿"

"What did the librarian say to the students?You just deleted the answer LMAOï»¿"
"Ehhh... This movie looks like a mess to me. The animation quality seems poor, and although having a whole bunch of spider men in one movie sounds cool, I really feel like the whole â€˜spider verseâ€™ aspect of the movie will really do a number on the story and overall heart of it. It doesnâ€™t excite me like a marvel movie trailer usually does. It really just feels too all over the place. I hope the movie does well, but this trailer doesnâ€™t make my opinion of it go higher than what I had previously thought of it.ï»¿"
"That Random Banana Animation isnâ€™t really poor, they just try to get a comic book feel with the animation. Itâ€™s just a different style than what weâ€™re used to.ï»¿"
"Thatâ€™s fair I guess. For me, by their making it more comic book-esque, theyâ€™re making the movie a bit too choppy for my taste.ï»¿"
Nice. I actually want to see itï»¿
Yes YES YESSSSSS!!!! This movie is going to be the sh*t!!!. Sony may not do well with live action this animated movie is going to be AWESOME.ï»¿

@Kappa Critic  YES! I couldn't put my finger on it but yes! Not even modern stop motion but OG King Kong!ï»¿

"I'm here because it's not God's will that any of you perish but all of you repent to receive eternal life. Many people are not prepared for the return of Jesus Christ. I've seen Him and He looks nothing like the famous pictures. He is coming back soon to judge the world. Repentance is a gift, now is the time to seek Him and turn away from all wrongful acts before it's too late.Many die suddenly and unexpectedly everyday, these are our friends and family. They enter hell for all eternity, because they died without Jesus Christ. I don't wish to see anyone of you in agony for all eternity. I'm in oneness with God's will. He loves and cares for you all.You have the voice to change the eternal destination of your friends and family members, if your willing. God will not force His will on anyone. If you care about them than you know the right decision, come work for the only kingdom that will last forever, if your willing. I wish to see many of you changed into the image of Christ and all for His Glory. I wish to see all you guys reunited in God's kingdom with your friends and family, but that will not happen unless you are willing to do God's will.If your willing seek God with all your heart until you find Him. He will speak to you at His time, once He does obey Him until the end, and even unto death. Your reward will be with Him in the only kingdom that will last forever, heaven.Take care and God bless youï»¿"

Nevermind Iâ€™m autistic. Just did research to make sure Iâ€™m not retarded and I am. Turns out that Marvel allowed Sony to make this since they were working on it before they bought the rights of Spider-Man back from Sony.ï»¿

@Luke Bannon yes. Is this part of the moviesï»¿
@Yung Mauz sequelï»¿
Same with the upside down kissing sceneï»¿
I had the same feeling.  That train scene from Spider-Man 2 sums up what Spider-Man is.ï»¿
Also the scene were they kiss and Spiderman is upside and the scene when Doc Ock throws a car at Mj and Peter (it's different though cause in the movie he wasn't in the Spider-Man costume when Doc Ock thru the car) so yeah the Spider-Man in this movie is basically the Toby Maguire Spider-Man and is the closest were gonna get to a Spider-Man 4ï»¿
"@CheesyPasta - Salad That isn't Tobey's Spiderman. Tobey's Spiderman has organic webs, this Spiderman has webshooters. Also ps4 Spiderman references some of those scenes as well. This is probably from the comics where Peter is 30 years old, and has a company called Parker Industries. He also has a secret base where he keeps his suits on display like Iron Man as you can see in the trailer.ï»¿"

@P0kegymTheHero it was pretty dark I was a really huge fan of the series. I had always wanted to see the story adapted in some form. Live action is a maybe if they were to get the right cast and budget but highly unlikely. I always thought it would work good as an animation.ï»¿

Could you also say... Superior?ï»¿
"No. Amazing, ultimate, and spectacular are popular Spider-man comic book series. The game's difficulties are based off of those Spider-man series and/or cliche Spider-man adjectives. It's more likely that's he was referencing the comics, not the difficulties in the game.ï»¿"

I'm happy about spider-gwen :Dï»¿
Me too!ï»¿
To bad they're not reallyï»¿
Shouldn't Peter be just a LITTLE weirded out that his dead former-girlfriend is (sort of) suddenly in front of him?   Unless they use a Peter from a continuity where Gwen wasn't a thing......ï»¿
This looks fucking litï»¿
Whatâ€™s it ratedï»¿
Miles' Black and Red suit is better than his Red and Blue oneï»¿
Yeees spiderman noir is my favoriteï»¿

"That Black Panther reference at 2:30 has to confirm a Black Panther animation movie, heâ€™d fit perfectly with sonys animation!ï»¿"
Excess Monopoly or miles is wakandanï»¿
"Although it kinda looks like the wakandan panther God statue, Black Panther is owned by Disney's Studios Marvel so a black panther animated movie will never happen under Sony's name.ï»¿"
@Rip Cord What if they partner with sony.ï»¿
"@Reginaldus Moes moon There's a good chance that won't be the case ever, as Disney isn't going to give Sony the rights to make a movie about one of their characters whilst they already exist in a live action universe (the MCU). Basically I mean Marvel isn't going to want another Black Panther to exist as an animated character, because they are focusing on him in his live action performance in the MCU. It's not impossible, but incredibly unlikely. I also dont think the statue was a Black Panther reference. There are many buildings in New York with that same exact ornament decorating their corner tops.ï»¿"
nic cage and john mulaney? Dopeï»¿
At 1:31 the background looks like the cover of Spider-Gwen #1ï»¿

Why isnâ€™t Tom Holland voice acting The red spiderman dude >:0ï»¿
Because this Spidey is in his late 30's and is married to MJ so Tom wouldn't work as this versionï»¿
1:39 Spider-Man PS4 suit behind might be aunt May?ï»¿
The movie is gonna be amazing but for ppl who want Tobey who is old af now to voice spiderman then y'all weird just go watch the movie and enjoy itï»¿
I still feel it's a missed opportunity to get Tobey to voice Peter. Maybe they could even get a cameo with Andrew's Spidey in. That would be neat.ï»¿

Plz tell me Spider-Ham says â€œThis is the height of luxuryâ€ù or â€œStreet Smartsâ€ù in this filmï»¿
"Iâ€™m confused, what the hell is thisï»¿"
"Well, it's actually Spider-Mens (Yes, plural, since they are many).In the lot, there are two that I have trouble understanding their possible importance in the film and especially their craze: The Spider Mecha (for the Japanese public and the fans of Mecha?) And Spider-Ham (for the kids or comic humor fans absurd and cartoonesque?).I'm going to see him, that's for sure, but I'm afraid that all these characters will encroach on Miles Morales' scriptural importance. Not totally convinced also for Spider-Gwen (I already said what I thought: ""We lose the dramatic side that had endured Peter, all his, blah blah ..."").Well, since it's centered on the Spider-Verse (with its 30/40 Spider-Man derivatives), we can understand this abundance of Spider-Mens for a single movie. To see, out of curiosity, and to know a little more (and maybe end up giving them some consideration) these multiple characters and their universes ^^ï»¿"

"If only this movie wasn't a SJW fest, this is so disappointing.ï»¿"
Eric Larson what do you meanï»¿
"What I mean is that the main Spider-Man, Peter Parker, is sidelined, for a black Spider-Man. I'm fine with a black Spider-Man, but when the main Spider-Man is a side character it makes me mad, and it seems like they are going for a, ""empowering,"" message that might be the good kind of empowering message.ï»¿"
Eric Larson that â€œblack spider manâ€ù is called miles moralesï»¿
"Yea, I know what his name is. What is your point?ï»¿"
And people want something with miles morales as the main characterï»¿
"Not saying that he can't be in a movie, but it's very, ""SJW,"" of Disney to make a movie where a black Spider-Man and a female Spider-man as the main characters, when the normal Spider-Man is just a side character. Even Stan Lee disagreed with what they did to Spider-Man. To quote him, ""I wouldnâ€™t mind, if Peter Parker had originally been black, a Latino, an Indian or anything else, that he stay that way. But we originally made him white. I donâ€™t see any reason to change that. ... It has nothing to do with being anti-gay, or anti-black, or anti-Latino, or anything like that. Latino characters should stay Latino. The Black Panther should certainly not be Swiss. I just see no reason to change that which has already been established when itâ€™s so easy to add new characters. I say create new characters the way you want to. Hell, Iâ€™ll do it myself.""ï»¿"
Eric Larson i donâ€™t get it can you just say something short and to the point whatâ€™s wrong with this movieï»¿

"@Matthew Smith It is not a Marvel movie, it's a Sony movie, but Marvel has given Sony the right to use some characters, like Spiderman, also, the main reason why Miles Morales is the main character is because his rights were bought by Sony in the 90s. Marvel isn't directing or financing the movie, they only appear as producers because they've let them use some characters.Anyway Stan's gonna appear for 5 seconds doing something, obviouslyï»¿"

"You used everyone's real name's except Peter Porker, for shame lolï»¿"
@Wacha Al Pharoh I fucking love that name Peter Porkerï»¿
We all need a little Peter Porker in our livesï»¿
@Prism Skull thats his real name in that universeï»¿
@Abstract Monkey I know I've just always found it funnyï»¿
how is no one talking about the fact Peni Parker is like literally the anime girl and will probably be made into the most memes (next to peter porker over here)ï»¿
@Jewel Mine  she is the evangelion spidermanÂ I remember when she blew up last timeï»¿
Soul Fox32 peter porker XDï»¿
her mecha from what I remember is Evangeilon reference in the comics anyway.ï»¿
Just Spider Ham being in the movie means I won't be seeing this garbage.ï»¿
@noisyturtle why?ï»¿
"Between Spider Gwen, Spider Ham, and whatever that anime girl cancer is - this film is appealing to the exact kinda person I fucking hate.ï»¿"
That Black Panther shot at the end know what I mean?ï»¿
why is the animation so 'choppy'?? it's so distractingï»¿
"Suppose to be like a comic, kinda like comic frames. Suppose to be noticable its part of the artstyle. A example, slowdown the footage and focus on the little deatails like the shading and lighing and artstyle.ï»¿"

Robert Wilson Um the scurrying away was hilarious. Also he only knows his version of Gwen. He knows nothing of Spider Gwen.ï»¿
"@Benjamin Ruggles I admit that the scurrying was funny, just odd.  You'll have to excuse me.  I've been  watching too much CinemaSins.Also, only knowing his version of Gwen is different from not knowing Gwen at all.  It's just a trailer, so it's unclear whether she has the mask or or not when he asks the question.Either way, I'm still excited.ï»¿"
peter parker is daddyï»¿
"1:35 that's Nicholas Cage by the way. If he doesn't go over the top this time, we riot.ï»¿"

Yeah but heâ€™s played by Nicholas Cageï»¿

Hell even the Spider-Gwen from the comic had normal hair with the classic headband. Maybe theyâ€™ll explain why the change in the film, itâ€™s not exactly movie ruining, just an odd design. I can see her and Peters interaction with each other being interesting seeing both of their history with eachother in their own respectable universes in the original Spider-Verse book.ï»¿"

Paulo Criales probably might be saved for a sequel if this film sky rockets.ï»¿
So this is basically that episode of ultimate spider from miles' perspective?ï»¿
The ending to the trailer  is awesome lolï»¿
One complaint. Toby McGuireâ€™s not voicing Peter Parker.ï»¿
Tristan McCannÂ  Probably because either Sony couldn't reach him or he is too busy to reprise his role.ï»¿
Yuri Lowenthal would have been a better choice anyway.ï»¿
"Nah, I like this voice actor and Yuri better than tobeyï»¿"
Just because it's referencing the old spider movies doesn't mean Toby McGuire should voice actor...let it goï»¿
"Josh da Quick! exactly, the Tom Holland fangirls and Tobey's fanboys are so annoyingï»¿"
"I think Jake Johnson kind of sounds like Tobey Maguire in this movie, like an impression.ï»¿"
@Jeremy Riley Sony isn't hiring him anymore.ï»¿
He ain't going for it anymore.ï»¿
Toby isn't a very good voice actorï»¿
Cuz heâ€™s a bad spideyï»¿
"Tobey's a terrible voice actor, look at the movie tie-in gamesï»¿"
He was either too stubborn or they didnâ€™t even bother with asking himï»¿

Why does it have to be animated???ï»¿
Jist so you know they wont show every spiderman in the trailer. They could add the 2099 spiderman. Some of these scenes might not even be in the movie and they cluld have easily removed 2099 or anyone else from the trailerï»¿
This is pure eye candyï»¿

snapkill 12.0 movie prob rushedï»¿
@biscuit they revealed this movie about late 2016 I believe so how is it rushed?ï»¿
I think it's just Parker. He's animated at a lower fps.ï»¿
"Hikarizu1 Everyoneâ€™s animated that way, thatâ€™s the point of the movie. The movie isnâ€™t rushed itâ€™s animated in a way to give off the comic book feelï»¿"
FirstName LastName it annoys me idk whyï»¿
that's intentional. everything moves in 60fps except the characters they run in 15fps... this is a never used effect which looks focking great it gives a comicbook kinda fibeï»¿
*23 fpsï»¿
UniqueNameGuy 15fpsï»¿
It gives it a neat Stop Motion aestheticï»¿
snapkill 12.0 The framrate is a stylistic choiceï»¿
You won't like it when you actually see it in the big screen.ï»¿
The spider mech from Japan tho! Kawaii is the phrase I would use!ï»¿

@Emma he voices spider hamï»¿
"Emma John Mulaney is the voice of Spider Ham, and heâ€™s about to â€œthrow the Spiderverse off itâ€™s rhythmâ€ù just like Detective JJ Bittenbinder told him to do with pedophiles back in middle school.ï»¿"

So is this continuing the Toby movies?ï»¿
"Is that an anime waifu with a Spider-Man mecha? Okey, iâ€™m all in.ï»¿"
Nicolas Cage as Spiderman Noir  is something I never know I needed until now.ï»¿
pretty sure they got a few spiders hidden for the movie. Hope itâ€™s the ottoâ€™s superior Spider-Man and 2099ï»¿
"Looks promising, but I have one problem, if your wanting to focus on Miles Morales, why shift the focus on other Spider-People, kind of detracts Miles being the lead character when there's a whole other batch of characters just like him.ï»¿"
James Smith completely agreedï»¿
James Smith that why it called spider man into the spider verse. It not only going to focus on just miles morales. But the rest of the spider man such as peter Parker Gwen Stacy and so on and so forth.ï»¿
@John Carter But it has been said over and over again that miles is the main characterï»¿
"That's fine, but if your going to do that then what's the point in having other Spider-People when you're main focus is Miles Morales, it's confusing because one minute we're focusing on Miles, then oh look there's Gwen no wait there's Peter. It doesn't give time for people to get to know Miles at all.ï»¿"
"I think the movie is going have the Spider-People be there to support Miles be the Spider-Man for his universe, and through that he'll have character development to have the audience to get to know him. The Spider-People are there for support and I hope they aren't too distracting for the audience to see the development point for Miles.ï»¿"
"I feel that the first act will be Miles focused on his origin and how he WANTS to be Spider-Man. The second act will introduce a version of Peter Parker who is alive (like the comics) and teach Miles how to webswing, etc. From that point forward, the other spider-people will teach him aspects of what make their take on being a hero is like. It'll be ""training"" and helping Miles because the Hero that his universe's New York will need.ï»¿"
"How does having a support cast detrimental to a main character? You're speaking as if Miles' only distinguishing character trait is that he's Spider Man, and he's just another Spider Man among Spiderpeople. But if he has a lot more going than that, then supporting characters would only lead to interesting interactions between Miles and the others.ï»¿"
Read the spiderverse comicï»¿
They might just be supporting characters. Plus the trailer doesn't really do it justice.ï»¿
"What I mean is your taking a character like Miles that not many people know and the your throwing in other character but only one of them the general public knows, my opinion is audience based which is why I'm saying it doesn't give an audience the chance of having a movie with just Miles and getting to know him rather than the audience having to read up on important comic book lore. If they're trying to make the movie about Miles do it don't throw in other Spider-People who not that many people know, it'll be confusing to the audience into who the protagonist is, I'm probably wrong, but let's just end it with me saying...guys it's just my opinion.ï»¿"
"If they add venom and 2099, then this would be the most beautiful treasure that God has given us.ï»¿"
Dray Henzie if that happens weâ€™re blessed to be in this timelineï»¿

"Mr Kings when used in the right way, venom can be amazingï»¿"
@Mr Kings everywhere? What do you mean?ï»¿
"Venom isnt even that cool, Carnage is the badass one.ï»¿"
We only have seen Venom once in theaters . . . Everywhere? What do you mean?ï»¿
Would love to see that but i kinda doubt it. But 2099...._Ÿ™èï»¿
Mr Kings cause people are hyped including me to see venom after years of his last appearance in the OG Spider-Man trilogy hoping this venom would be  satisfying and awesome but I get it I been seen a lot of venomï»¿
"Heâ€™s been in mostly every Spider-Man game including Marvelâ€™s Spider-Man, and soon to be Marvelâ€™s Spider-Man 2. I havenâ€™t been keeping up with the comics but Iâ€™m sure he either has a solo comic or is a big character in one of the many Spider-Man runs going right now. He has a solo movie too.ï»¿"

Honestly I want to like it but i donâ€™t peter Parker is the only Spider-Man to me _Ÿ_·â€çâ™‚ï¸è sorryï»¿
cool but why is he blackï»¿
He should be Miles Morales. Like if you agree.ï»¿
A cartoon???? Yeah don't care about this ......ï»¿
Whatâ€™s wrong with cartoons? This movie has a really unique style to it.ï»¿
@michaelcritic there for kids !!!!ï»¿
Anomalisa is an animated movie that isnâ€™t for kids. Thereâ€™s graphic sex scenes and life lessons to be learned for all ages. You sir do not understand movies at all.ï»¿
"@michaelcritic this looks like it's straight off Nickelodeon!!! I love the Simpson's, South park but I can't get into these sort of cartoons as a adult !!!ï»¿"
Who cares if itâ€™s for kids? I can enjoy a movie like Deadpool 2 or Blade Runner 2049 just as much as I can enjoy Big Hero 6.ï»¿
"@michaelcritic that's the problem with men in 2018 !!! All these man baby's watching kids cartoons ( my little pony, anime ) collecting toys , playing video games !!! Men's testosterone is dropping every year ; modern men are basically women !!!!! As a grown Australian male I don't have any time for kids television ! No offence to youï»¿"
"How manly you are isnâ€™t affected by watching an animated movie. Also, whatâ€™s wrong with being a woman? You shouldnâ€™t push people to be more â€œmanlyâ€ù because you canâ€™t be less manly from watching an animated film. You should enjoy life more and stop crying about testosterone.ï»¿"
"@michaelcritic what isn't wrong with modern women !!!!!!????? If  like being a "" manly"" man and I miss when it was celebrated and masculinity was revered !! Now it's consider toxic and now we have a generation of cuck soy boy betas who haven't developed past being 11 ! And the epidemic of single mothers and never been shown how to be a man is the cause !! Thanks feminism!!!!!!ï»¿"
"This is Amazing, Spectacular, Sensational, Ultimately awesome bro!!!!ï»¿"
It's all-new AND all-different!ï»¿
You forgot Superiorï»¿
Really excited for this movie but wouldâ€™ve been cool for this to be more of a miles movie.ï»¿

The best character in this is Spider HAMï»¿
"At least I think I saw the Raimi suit. Also Peter Porker is always a win. Although 2099 would be nice, maybe a end credits scene sequel setup?ï»¿"
John Mulaney playing as spider ham is by far the funniest thing here.ï»¿

Spider-Ham debued in the comics 24 years before the SImpsons made that dumb joke.  Spider-ham has nothing at all to do with Spider-Pig other than being pig like.  Spider Ham isn't even technically a pig.  He's a spider that got bitten like a pig and now resembles one.  Comics are weird.ï»¿
From the Simpsons movie lolï»¿

Kanahaiyah it's a Christmas miracleï»¿
That'd more likely happen if this is a success & they make a sequelï»¿
There's probably a cameo from at least one of themï»¿
Do we really need more Andrew Garfield? Lets forget it happend and enjoy Tobey's and Tom's versions.ï»¿
Tobey reference is in this filmlï»¿
They better.ï»¿

Yea! Spider ham!!ï»¿

I like how they had tobey Spider-Man scenes. Should put Garfieldâ€™s scenes in there tooï»¿
The train stopping scene was from : Spider-Man 2ï»¿
Ffs now there divercyfying spidermanï»¿
The entire cast of thia movie is what has me most excitedï»¿
"Someone please tell me, doesn't it make more sense for the SPIDER MAN to have webs shoot from his body rather than from devices he wears on his wrists?Am i wrong here?Am i thinking backwards?Because I've heard folks say its dumb he can make the webs himself.So heightened senses, wall crawling, super strength, and a more agile body are top priority over having the one ability of a spider people even care or know about?Why would he get all that baggage but have to create artificial webbing?I'm actually curious.ï»¿"
I honestly think there should be more spidermenï»¿
Why is Kingpin involved with a collider?ï»¿
Hyped for this movieï»¿

"This movie looks Amazing, Spectacular, Superior, Ultimate....you get the idea.ï»¿"
"I don't know what it is about this art style, but I get motion sick every time I watch one of the trailers. Which is a shame, because the movie looks good, but I honestly don't think I could watch a full-length version of this, at least in theaters. Maybe when they release it on Blu-Ray and I can pause every time I get nauseous I'll give it a try.ï»¿"
Why doesnâ€™t peter know Gwen?ï»¿
she has her mask on.ï»¿

"Kamil Magomedov True but in the cancelled The Amazing Spider-Man 3, there was supposed to be a clone of Gwen with spider powers that would obviously be called Spider-Gwen. I think that after the ending of TASM2, those events did happen, even if we didn't see it happenï»¿"

He's got to be next. I want to see a Live action 2099 so bad. But with animation like this I'd be good with it too.ï»¿
"+Magneto that's what I was thinking!!!!We're also missing iron spider, spider X, Spider-Punk, Spider-Girl and Spider-Woman.ï»¿"
Superior Spiderman?ï»¿
Yeah and I want to see him because he is the first alternate spiderman I knewï»¿
You must not read comics if you think we're only missing one spidey lmao. _Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
exactly 2099 is part of the big 3ï»¿
"But what we really miss is supaidaman. He was in the comics, so why not in the film?ï»¿"
Yeah it feels wrong without himï»¿
Capitan Britain Spider-Man anyone?ï»¿
So basically these are all the different possibilities of who the spider could have bit and all these possibilities are living in different dimensions. These are all parallel universes i guess? Thats my theory anyway.ï»¿
"Are you trying to insinuate that this Spider-Man is the same one from the Raimi films?EDIT: After rewatching the trailer, there are some differences in the Raymi references. It seems like this one is a goofy mashup of the Raymi  films universe and the Ultimate Spider-Man comic book universe.ï»¿"

He's a mix of raimi and amazing. Both Sony Spiderman's. Theyre combining them.ï»¿
Krystal Myth itâ€™s trash not the movie but spidermanï»¿
Tears of joy in my eyes when i saw that.ï»¿
"Krystal Myth there was no reference to the awful amazing spiderman films, only the sam raimi films.ï»¿"
Itâ€™s just a reference lol. Just because it isnâ€™t Tobey doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s bad.ï»¿
"@Jojo 1961 the comic books, not the movies.ï»¿"
Cripple Jesus ohhh ok then.ï»¿
"Cripple Jesus reading that dude comment again, he is literally talking about the amazing spiderman films.ï»¿"
"@Jojo 1961 Yeah, I didn't notice that it first. Sorry. But this definitely has nothing to do with those films. It's a combination of Raymi Spider-Man and at the Ultimate Spider-Man comics.ï»¿"

"I know right, its like Sony are cherry picking which ones to have for their chosen humour and tone rather than fully using the Spider Verse roster of characters. I mean having Peter, Miles, and Gwen is nice but they are the popular adaptations, whilst Spider Ham, and Peni Parker look like they are set to rehash Sony's tired humour.Sucks really, could have used more Spider men/women but Sony doesn't want toï»¿"

So the Peter Parker in Into the Spider-Verse is the Spider-Man in the Tobey Maguire movies?ï»¿
Alex Martinez I think they're combining both the 1st series and 2nd series Spider-Man into one with giving him an older Andrew Garfield Spider-Man personality...just my assumption btwï»¿
Alex Martinez this Parker has mechanical web-shooters.ï»¿
Lew Archer 1949 Right just like Andrew Garfield Spider-Manï»¿
@Lew Archer 1949 Maybe later on in his years Raimi Spider-Man developed mechanical Web Shooters in case his powers crap out on him again like in Spider-Man 2?ï»¿
"They're combining both of the spiderverses they had rights to. That's who this one is. So in a way somethit entirely new, but yes you know its roots.ï»¿"
"@Daddy Long Legs Man that makes no sense. His organic web-shooters did not ""give up on him"", he just gave up on being Spider-Man.ï»¿"
"Yeah but, Spider Pig is the MAIN hero hereï»¿"
"@Kamil Magomedov seems like you need to rewatch Spider-Man 2 then, because he gave up on being Spider-Man because his powers were failing him. Like, nearly half an hour was dedicated to powerless Peter Parker in the film.ï»¿"
"@Daddy Long Legs Man I think you misunderstood the message of the movie. Peter's life is going downhill: he's failing his classes, he gets fired, his relationship with Harry and MJ is getting worse all the time. And all because he chooses Spider-Man routine over Peter Parker routine. Hence why he starts to doubt whether it's even worth being a hero or not. Which is precisely when his powers start failing him. Literally watch any analysis of this movie on YouTube and you'll hear the same thing.ï»¿"

Jean Valverde pretty sure Scarlett spider is in the same universe as peter Parker and at this point he is dead or somewhere else.ï»¿

Miles morales is literally peter parler if he were black.I dont get the point especially since hes a boring character.ï»¿
"@Anthony Batista boring character when his comics are selling more than Peter parkers in the recent years? He's not a clone of Peter but black, he has his own story if your bothered to actually read itï»¿"
+abrelosojosputa Miles is a great character but that's just not true.ï»¿

Elora Maxwell will never beat the. 1984 transformers thoï»¿
To each their own but I think it looks really horrible at times. I don't like the laggy and annoying low framerate animation style they are using and there is this ugly overuse of what looks to be chromatic aberration everywhere. The most ugly effect used in games and movies.ï»¿
Coolï»¿
Its like stop motion claymation to me. I agree its a retro style i love.ï»¿

"Dare I say, it could even be Superior to most animations.ï»¿"
"Merwanor luckily this ""issue"" seems to be fixed. There's a short piece of the movie at the end of Venom's credits, and it's sooo smooth. Let's just hope the whole movie is like that, although the various frame rates are not a problem to me, I totally get your point!ï»¿"

@Shawn Altamar the scene where Peter is stopping the train is a scene from spiderman 2 the greatest spiderman movie of all timeï»¿
And the upside down kiss from Spiderman 1ï»¿
This looks goodï»¿
AMAZING!!!!!!!ï»¿
Peter Parker looks a lot like Tobey Maguire and many elements are from the original Spiderman series . I wish he would had given voice to his character.ï»¿
From the teaser this seemed like an exploration of miles story and a step towards seeing if Marvel could do mature animation (looks like miles dad was supposed to be killed as he looks at a gravestone) but seeing this I cant help but feel it has been zombified into a Christmas kids cash grab...this  is  so  sad  .ï»¿
i lost it an anime spidermanï»¿
Too.........many..........Spider-Man...........ï»¿
At first I didnâ€™t think this was going to be very good... now THIS trailer?!?! I will be seeing this 100%! I love all the real world humor and references and seeing Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey and not just miles morales makes me happy.ï»¿
So peter will survive and hopefully will have a big role as in a role equal to miles in the sense hes miles partner and has a role as big as himï»¿
Spider-Gwen looks low key hot in Into The Spider-Verse they did a great job with her design.ï»¿

Why isn't this a real life movie?ï»¿
Nabeel Khan wanna see a REAL pig in a REAL Spider-Man costume?ï»¿
Nabeel Khan this is sony spiderverse not marvel studios version. They connect this world with the original spiderman movies. U can see mary jane kissing spiderman from spiderman 1 and spiderman fought on trainï»¿
"@Ryuzaki Raiga Emphasis on Spiderverse, because by that logic, all Spiderman films are connected to one and another.ï»¿"
@Ryuzaki Raiga Except he has mechanial web shooters. This is an older 616 Spider-Man. Not the Raimi Spider-Man/96283 Spider-Man.ï»¿

Homer Simpson would be so proud...ï»¿
Joey Bu ...... omg i just realized thatâ€™s exactly what they did _Ÿ˜…ï»¿
You know Spider-Ham first appeared in 1983ï»¿
@James Young I don't think they're real fansï»¿
Awesomeï»¿
I have feeling this going be a spiderverse trilogy leading up to spidergeddon or part avengers serect wars.ï»¿
tashawn mcrae this is under sony spiderman not marvel studio.version so no avengersï»¿
"Ryuzaki Raiga Well, Advanced Suit Spider-Man (PS4) is in here and heâ€™s confirmed for Spider-geddon.ï»¿"

@Benjamin Ruggles He's just making a Simpsons reference man. -_-ï»¿
Manuel Alberto Romero So? If youâ€™re gonna make jokes know what youâ€™re talking about.ï»¿
The animation looks weird but seems like it will be ok!ï»¿
T R its like stop motion.ï»¿
@Ryuzaki Raiga yeah it's probably like 12 frame's that's my guessï»¿
"And in this universe i am not Spiderman and it sucks.....we need to find the Spidey of this universe, get into work internet.ï»¿"
The dislikers are from another dimension tooï»¿
Ok so multiple dimensions spider man Iâ€™m all for itï»¿
This movie looks amazing!ï»¿
Spider is stealing wallets with webs.ï»¿
"Always been a fan of Miles, but after seeing him come to life (animated wise) on PS4's Spider-Man, I really want to see more Miles. Hyped for this!ï»¿"
PS4â€™s Spider-Man also bright Miles to live for me. So glad I played that game.ï»¿
Watch the ultimate Spiderman spiderverse episode. Sort of feels like this Miles.ï»¿
"Original Spiderman, Miles Spiderman, Gwen Spiderman, and even a film noir Spidey okay. But the Porky Pig Spidey and anime mecha girl spiderman threw me off. Will still watch though.ï»¿"
"Spider Ham is an essential to any ""Spider-Verse"" filmï»¿"
SPIDER PIG????!!!!!!! The Simpsons knew........ï»¿
Yeah spider ham is from the 80s. He existed before the simpsons did that jokeï»¿

So this is miles is in the new game..ï»¿
Dont like toons.ï»¿
Looks better than homecoming I know I'm going to get backlash but I hated homecoming why did everyone like itï»¿
"that guy glubey me too, i hype myself to much by thinking marvel studio gonna do justice but they ruin it by making peter doesn't have motivation, villain are not scary at all unlike sony version and the visual its badï»¿"
"that guy glubey I loved the suit, not the story. Donâ€™t worry, people who love homecoming are Tom Holland fan girls so youâ€™re good dude.ï»¿"
"Uh...because that version of Spider-Man was closest to the comic book version. An opinion that even STAN LEE himself has said publicly. Seriously people, read a comic book or something. _Ÿ__â€çâ™‚ï¸èï»¿"
"Major Glitch Suit is VERY accurate, thatâ€™s why love the suit. However heâ€™s basically getting help from Tony Stark, which didnâ€™t happen in the comics. The only time he got help from Stark in the comics was fighting off Carnage.!ï»¿"
Also not many people liked the whole multiple villains thing that Sony did in the previous Spider-man movies so Marvel got a plus on that.ï»¿
@TheDude107 not going to argue with that you are 1000% correctï»¿
Spider-Ham is in the movie! My prayers have been answered!ï»¿
"You are weird, it isn't a bad thing. But Spider-Ham, really? Spider-Ham, so Sony is going DC with live action and animation. Animation awesome live action take it or leave itï»¿"
Youâ€™re comment is everything I dislike about the world we live in.ï»¿
There's a comic version where The X-Bugs & Fantastic Furr make their debut.ï»¿

"Spider-Gwen looks hot! Can't wait for this, just finished Spider-Man on PS4!ï»¿"
"Ugh, not a fan of Gwenâ€™s SJW Millennial Troglodyte hairstyle.ï»¿"
"So, you have a problem with her hair being short? Some women don't like to have long hair, you know.ï»¿"
"Inugami X9 incorrect, just not a fan of those kind of hairstyles. Iâ€™m actually not a fan of many hair trends that our poor excuse for a generation has come up with. Also no, I have no problem with Women having shorter hair. Some of my favorite fictional female characters so happen to have short hair. Stop trying to put words in my mouth and stop being a dumb little SJW and finding sexism in everything. Never in my short and small little comment did I say I have a problem with women having short hair.ï»¿"
"Inugami X9 if you want to have a debate about what I said, then letâ€™s have one about what it actually said instead of what your feeble little mind thought it said.ï»¿"
Who is Gwen voiced by? I swear it's on the tip of my tongue.ï»¿
I'm pretty sure spider man noir is gonna use his powers to steal the Declaration of Independence.ï»¿
Umm... The train scene and him mentioning a comic book. No 4th wall anymore?? Love itï»¿
Boy ho boy this is the best trailer of the year WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOWwwwwwwwwwwwwwï»¿
At 1:39 you can see the insomniac spider man suit behind aunt may.ï»¿
"the embodiment of light & darkness, so the question remains is this the ps4 Spider-Man or the 616ï»¿"
@Hiccup Parker I have been thinking that alsoï»¿
the embodiment of light & darkness I hope the ps4 version replaces the 616 version sort of what DC did with the new 52ï»¿
the embodiment of light & darkness Dude! Nice catch. Finished that game last week!ï»¿
@Fearless 4 Him yeah me too got platinum trophy.ï»¿
Hiccup Parker Itâ€™s not replacing him. Heâ€™s being added to the 616 in the new Spider-Geddon #0.ï»¿
"@Hiccup ParkerBut with New 52, it wasn't just one character. It was the whole universe that was revamped.Insomniac's Spider-Man wouldn't just seamlessly fit in with the mainline 616 comics without another major revamp.ï»¿"
whoa nice catch!ï»¿
LeanGreenMeme maybe not but marvel could do it if they wantedï»¿
Fearless 4 Him well that maybe a bad idea considering the relationships that they have with othersï»¿
the embodiment of light & darkness good eyeï»¿
"Dude, nice eye.ï»¿"
Thatâ€™s pretty fucking coolï»¿
That is an amazing reference.ï»¿
After the fantastic game they made they deserve to have there suit shown in the movie.ï»¿
Great eye thanks for pointing that outï»¿
"the embodiment of light & darkness good job, thanks for pointing that outï»¿"
OKAY WHAT THE HELLï»¿
WTF LETS GOï»¿
I think it's the 2099ï»¿
@gabriel da costa e siva magalhaes boi?ï»¿
Hiccup Parker What the hell is 616? Is it the original suit name or what? I'm getting so confused because I remember that there was an Earth 616.ï»¿
"Wow, to think that you even noticed itï»¿"
I don't feel so goodï»¿
What is the embodiemeny of light and darknessï»¿
@Soupyy_ 616 is the main and original marvel universe. The 616 suit is basically the red and blue classic suitï»¿
"SoiSej Makes sense, thanks.ï»¿"
1:42 SPIDER PIGGYï»¿
Yeah that's interestingï»¿

Anyone else find the animation weird?ï»¿
Manan Gosalia its stop motion animation. Its popular in 80's movie. I think British did with dog and human animation using clay but i forgot the titleï»¿
Dead Mary Jane??ï»¿
What?ï»¿
Where did you get that fromï»¿
Noir Spider-Man! YESSSï»¿
Is Spider Man Noir gonna have a gun? That'd be cool.ï»¿
Spider-Ham! Good old Peter Porker!ï»¿
what's up with frame rate? this is highly annoyingï»¿
It will be in netflix?ï»¿
I jus love it_Ÿ˜ç_Ÿ˜ç_Ÿ˜çï»¿
"Animation looks nice, but I don't think the film will do the Spider Verse story justice. Some things look cool like Spider Gwen and of course Peter and Miles, but others such as Spider Man Noir look strange or cherry picked from the plethorah of characters from the story to fit a certain audience and humour threshold which is always a no from me. Due to its tone I feel like they will skip past or undermine some potential for good storytelling if that makes sense(?) such as Spider Gwen's backstory and Spider Man Noir's background.ï»¿"
I hate itï»¿
Why Though? it looks so good i love the art styleï»¿
it looks really odd.... i will give it a try but right now i hate the trailersï»¿
No Ben Reilly? :(ï»¿
Noir looks fucking AWSOME!ï»¿
"The animation looks amazing, kinda reminds me of ""Kubo & The Two Strings""ï»¿"
"Where is Spider Knight, Spider 2022, and Spider man from England(i forgot the name)ï»¿"

Gabriel VerÃ_ssimo yes that's the name! Just remember nowXDï»¿

"With so many spidermen and women, will uncle Ben die those many times or are we finally past that?ï»¿"
Spider loli - YES YES YES!ï»¿

Is the Prowler going to be in this?  If he is that would be so coolï»¿

He is in the last trailerï»¿

i am waiting.... for the fun to begin on Christmasï»¿
My man had the 1s onï»¿
I WANNA SEE THIS AS A LIVE ACTION!  ANYONE ELSE!ï»¿
"No cause it limits what you can do visually and everyone needs to look realistic limiting artistic creativity, expression and the variety of shapes of the characters (Notice the contrast between some of the characters). I'd rather see all Superhero movies animated that way skin tight costumes don't seem so silly and you won't get ugly costumes that look uncomfortable, they can look buff as hell,  they can jump from building to building and flip all over without looking too cgi. Animation all the way!!!ï»¿"
Isn't this from the director who supports Antifa's violent actions?ï»¿
1:39 is that the ps4 suit in the very back??ï»¿
why does the animation look like it's missing a few framesï»¿
"I didn't think they'd include Spider-Ham, and yet there he is.ï»¿"
Rick and Morty but with spiders.ï»¿
The different art styles are really intriguing! I cannot wait for this to come out!ï»¿
Take my money!!! Take it!ï»¿
Spider-Man 2099?!ï»¿
Does anyone feel the 3Dness in the Backgroundï»¿
1:43 is spiderham left handedï»¿
Sony stick to this. Forget about live action. Please for the love of god.ï»¿
Spiderman 2 say helloï»¿
Iâ€™d be more excited if Gwen Stacy wasnâ€™t Spider-Man as well... wtf???ï»¿
If you were an actual fan youâ€™d know that version has existed for a while.ï»¿
That's been part of the comics for a long timeï»¿
Finally a mainstream super-hero movie that's freakin animated !!! :D I love this!ï»¿
WHEN IS THE GODDAM SONG FOR THIS TRAILER GOING TO BE RELEASED?ï»¿
Hopefully this film heavily is based around miles instead of every spider man cause if we have this much spider men in most scenes it will be badï»¿
NICK CAGE!!!ï»¿
No Miguel?ï»¿
"Ossm vdo.https://youtu.be/GeiZV9Vf35oï»¿"

I think it has the sam raimi's story but with an older andrew garfield versionï»¿
"@âù°GÃ˜Dâù± NomadeHe has mechanial web shooters. Sam Raimi's version had organic web shootersï»¿"
Ultimate gamerxx trulyï»¿
"Ultimate gamerxx I know right, first the stopping the train scene from Spider-Man 2 and then the iconic upside down kiss, some people are even saying this version of Spider-Man is the Sam Raimi version, personally I don't think this is true, I think the writers just added those scenes as a nice little reference and nothing more.ï»¿"
ikr? that was awesome. :)ï»¿
"Oh yes,the really good stuff.ï»¿"
"All of you are idiots. He isn't one of the actors grown-up, and he doesn't even seem to be Insomniac's Peter. He's just Spider-Man. Plain and simple Comic Book Peter.ï»¿"

"Considering Peter doesn't know who Gwen is, this isn't going to happen.ï»¿"

Perhaps he just doesnâ€™t recognize her because sheâ€™s a teenager and the Gwen Stacy of her universe was on college maybe in her early 20sï»¿
That would be beautiful.ï»¿
"Sadly I don't think the film will have anything like that, it would break its tone (it looks audience pandering for me in terms of humour and for some of the characters) which sucks because it would be a cool momentï»¿"

He has mechanial web shooters. Toby didn't.ï»¿
I'm sure it was just a cool Easter egg referencing those movies :)ï»¿
It's the original spiderman but older and experienced. He looks like he's in his early 30s or late 20s.ï»¿
KappaK Itâ€™s kind of like in the lego Batman movie when they referenced all the different Batman movies but technically didnâ€™t happenï»¿
"KappaK Last time we saw Tobey he was in his early 20s while this Peter is said to be in his 40s, would be cool if it were true but itâ€™s unlikelyï»¿"

forget Venom... i think sony should just stick to animation with their spidey-related stuff other than the one w tom holland & the mcu... leave the live action stuff to MARVEL.ï»¿
Let's wait and seeï»¿
Funk O'Matic u do realize the mcu is just Disney with rights to marvel charactersï»¿
Disney** u meanï»¿
I'm with you on that and besides this open the door for so many possibilities.ï»¿
No wayï»¿
"Funk O'Matic I got a bad feeling about Venom. Tom Hardy already complaining his favorite scenes got cut, the director saying they always were going for PG13 knowing full well fans supported them because they promised us a hard R rating because of how well Logan & Deadpool didï»¿"
xx Alvexas xx Youre right about marvel characters and all but Sony owns all rights to spiderman not disneyï»¿
No give Sam rami back the directing rights and let HIM take care of the actionï»¿

Agreedï»¿

"@xx Alvexas xx here...lemme educate. when spidey appears in mcu movies..yup, those movies are produced by feige & co, at the MARVEL STUDIOS, owned by Disney. Disney might OWN the marvel brand..but those who actually WORK on the movies are marvel STUDIOS people...but when he is in his solo movies..they're produced by Sony, owned by Sony..however..from what we've learned..the actual production of Himecoming was actually done by feige & his ppl as well...but still under the Sony banner.so...what's ur point exactly..?ï»¿"
OhMyGoodnessSix I didnâ€™t say they did theyâ€™re pretty much borrowing him from Sonyï»¿
Funk O'Matic my point being is that u said leave the live action to marvel when itâ€™s still technically marvel working on venom with ur logicï»¿
"@xx Alvexas xx nope...i daid the sony's spidey SOLO movies with tom holland are being done by marvel ppl...UNDER Sony banner, NOT disney.now, Venom, on the other hand...still dont know if it's actually in the same spideyverse as holland's or not (n from the reviews so far...God, i hope they're NOT related).this venom thang as most of us know is all sony, namely that chick exec, AVI ARAD (the guy behind raimi's disastrous spiderman 3..yup he's even recently admitted to it)..n his partner in meddling, sonething tolmach... n feige'd explicitly said he never want avi n his partner to be around spudey, as long as it's in the mcu.ï»¿"

"They literally went and a made a 3d animated movie to prove that Miles Morales should've been the new spider man. Better story already, not the time tired high school student peter parker, whining about being spider man or something even worse (wanting to be an avenger gg). We got spider qwen too here. Yes it definitely has some silly angles (what even with the pig and anime girl) but we have a main villain and I saw scorpion and I believe Lizard.ï»¿"
OneAndOnlySound Nope. Just goes to show you know nothing about Spider-Man. And that wasnâ€™t the Lizard.ï»¿
"I said ""I believe"" like there was some kind of scorpion incarnation and something later for like a second. Also, if you don't have anything to say but ""nope you know nothing about spider man"" then move along and enjoy disney tv show level high school drama iron-spider. Wish he would've (we know he isn't or there wouldn't be a sequel being known/made) died in infinity war and been replaced by miles morales, time for something different we already had two prior spider man franchises and they had their faults too but they weren't as awful at that watered down I wanna be an avenger rushed cheap special effects homecoming stuff. Spider man comes into the MCU and that's the best thing they can think of with the amount of material they have/could've used. Michael Keaton as Vulture was the only good thing and it'd have been better if he'd had much better material to work with. The ""ackward girlfriend's father is my nemesis"" moment was just plain bad. Also as if Iron Man didn't crap all over Mandarin, shocker got the same treatment in homecoming. Made Venom from 3 look good by comparison-at least he actually was a Venom, even rushed with bad casting.ï»¿"

That's funny because there are at least a dozen Peter Parkers. Miles is a good Spidey anyways. Why do you care so much that Pete isn't the main protagonist?ï»¿

Best spiderman movieï»¿
Spiderman wants you to like my comment...ï»¿
Guess the multiverse is the best way for SJWs to bastardize established characters as much as they want. ^^ï»¿
Faf-kun read a comic man. Miles has been around for 7 years now. Spider Gwen and Peni Parker has been around for 4 years. Spider ham has been around for 35 years. Spider man noir has been around for 9 years. I mean would you prefer for marvel to make Peter Parker into a black-female-vegan-noir-pig or just make new characters that can stand alongside Peter Parker. I really donâ€™t see how this is a bastardization of his character.ï»¿
im curious...who (besides kids) are gonna waste their money on this movie?ï»¿
Spider-Man fans (looks to be the best Spider-Man made) and animation fans (this animation is gorgeous and unique).ï»¿
It will be so good if they make Toby make a voiceover for Peter Parker and spider man or at least Andrewï»¿

@marvelousdcgeek 97 Oh ok i didnt see the robot in the beginning at firstï»¿
Peni Parker? I know everyone else but is she new or something?ï»¿
"Peni Parker isn't super new, she was introduced in the original Spider-Verse. But she didn't get as much attention as Gwen or Noir, she was just a throwback to anime influences.Kind of cool that they're introducing her here too.The Spider-Verse saga might not have been great, but it introduced a lot of really cool ideas.ï»¿"
"@ThatKidSavage_11 relatively new, she was in the spider verse thing in the comics last yearï»¿"
ThatKidSavage_11 She debuted in an Edge of the Spider-Verse issue in 2014ï»¿
fun fact. Peni Parker was created by Gerard Way of My Chemical Romanceï»¿
That's cool thanks for telling me peopleï»¿

"Gerard Way who was the singer of ""My Chemical Romance"" created her btw. He did a comic a few years ago in the ""edge of the spiderverse"" series. Not a fan of the music but it was a good comic.ï»¿"

"1:36 Is that Peni Parker of SP//dr!? It looks different, maybe a reworking of the idea?ï»¿"
Yep.ï»¿
"Funny I was under the impression that Hispanic like Cubans, Puerto Ricans and Dominicans. Hated dark skinned  Afro-Latino like Haitians, and also have a problem with African Americans. Now your hyping Miles?ï»¿"

Why does this movie have the Telltale gamesâ€™ framerate?ï»¿
This is looking amazing but am I the only one who has a problem with Parker and Wilsonâ€™s voicesï»¿
How cool it'd be if we hear Tobey Maguire's voice as Peter Parker ! _Ÿ’¯_Ÿ”¥ï»¿

"I had a debate about ciri being casted as a black or Asian ethnicity, me claiming that there is only the 2 verses of the Witcher one being the books and the other the games.  And in both she was of Nordic background and white and such.So I was like hey fans want there characters to be as they remembered. Not changed for literally zero reasons.Then I tried to meet in the middle and say we'll there's a black spider man, and female, however they are there own characters with there own development which allows them to be great characters and leaves the original alone.Then the dude was like ""oooooooohh so it's good as long as there segregated?""I'm like how they connect the verses all the time?And here we are. Lol can't wait.ï»¿"
Awesome!!!!!ï»¿

"all these sam raimi comments saying his trilogy was the best, but it was the most comic book inaccurate depiction of spiderman stories weâ€™ve seen, in spiderman 1, mj falling off the bridge was supposed to be gwen stacy being thrown off by green goblin and that was her death scene, spiderman had organic webbing which was retarded, the black suit looked completely inaccurate and how he got it was inaccurate too, in the comics it was given to him by reed richards, emo parker was dumb asf, spiderman 2 was good thoughï»¿"

If only they would bring back Spider-Carnage (Ben Reilly or Peter Parker clone) as villain it would be perfect (and would have a link with the end of the old show of Amazing Spiderman.)ï»¿
00:13 just punched the Car_Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
The idea is not bad but i have to give it a dislike for Miles and that shitty SJW Gwen.ï»¿

I'm so overexcited i thought that last scene was Wakanda _Ÿ˜‚ï»¿
The frame rate is too badï»¿
this actually looks good. only thing i don't like is the stop motion effects. why couldn't they just make it regular 3d animation? why add those dizzying stop motion effects. its looks weird.ï»¿
At least release the fcking songï»¿
"I'm throwing money at my screen but nothing's happening!_Ÿ_·_Ÿè_â€çâ™‚ï¸èï»¿"

@Levi Mixon not too familiar with the spiderverse I seeï»¿
"Y'all just had your own black-power Wakanda action going on (not to be confused with the technologically advanced real world Uganda); why you gotta culturally appropriate our spider man heroes?   Bad enough they already made Heimdall (in Nordic lore described as ""the whitest of the Gods"", not even joking) a black guy.    What's next, are we going to have Oprah cast as George Washington?ï»¿"
"@DumbDuck44 Race doesn't matter, a character is not defined by his ethnicityï»¿"
"Psycho Joe I am familiar actually, I was just pointing out the atrocious art style they are using for this movie. It's choppy and looks like garbage to meï»¿"
"If it doesn't matter, then why do we have to replace spider man with a kid that looks like a used q-tip?   Make a new different superhero, and stop taking our heroes.     Or tell you what, how about we make Blackpanther be a freckled red headed guy, and Wakanda is a village in Poland.ï»¿"

"Why does the animation look so jerky? You paid to build these beautiful 3d models and world, just render it at a normal frame rate! (or whatever it would take to fix this issue)ï»¿"
It looks like they are incoperating elements of stop motion into it which makes sense this movie seems to be utilizing a bunch of animation styles.ï»¿
Id say that now majority of people have finished spiderman ps4 is why the trailer is coming out now. You gotta consider how well Sony is with their timing.ï»¿
Where is Spider-Cop??!ï»¿
The BGM is awesome. Anybody knw tht song?ï»¿

No idea if this means anything but does Spider-man normally train with a VCR/DVD player thing? He's using it to learn how to web swing here but in Civil War when we first meet him he has one in his hands when he meets Tony.ï»¿

Fucking Nick Cage as Spider-Man Noir. Definitely seeing this film.ï»¿
Why the framerate is like 14 or sthï»¿
"no. I can not believe it, it is a wonderful trailer, I love the idea that they are going to join the spiderman in a team like in the comics, and I love it. they are great. It is seen that it will be a very tender film and I do not know why but I have the impression that I will get some tears, if they are happy, emotional or sad, it does not matter.

PixelConcept So true. Lolï»¿
Not true though.ï»¿
"Theres a ton of spider people in the currect comics continuity, Peter and Miles are alive at the same time(both are spiderman), there's also Spider Woman, etc etc.Miles first appearance was in 2011 when he became Spiderman after Peter gets killed by the Green goblin. That was in the Ultimate universe, it doesnt exist anymore and it merged with the ""Amazing"" one (the original one) after Secret Wars.ï»¿"
"People online who are ""anti-SJW"" freak out more than ""SJWs"" do when a superhero is made to be a POC. It's also not like they just made this character up now as a diversity plea; as [P]oX said, there has been a black spiderman since 2011. 7 years. Get over yourself.ï»¿"

Your pretty late buddy miles has been a main stay spider for awhile now dude. Also he's actually a pretty cool character to follow I mean we've  been following Peter for forever why not show the other spidys some love?ï»¿
"Jason R Hey buddy,you blow in from stupid town?ï»¿"
It's not a matter of showing other spider men love?  It's a matter of what Spider-Man is... Peter Parker.  Again we even have black panther???  The only reason this Spider-Man exists is cause people cry racist at the sight of a white super hero and if not enough color is involved in such spotlight it's a problem... when really the big problem is recreations like this.  Should we start making things that were black culture white?  People can hate my comment I really don't care. I'm not racist I have a good mix of friends by my side and we all think this movement going on in the world is nothing more than a waste of everyone's time.  Maybe roots would be a better film if it was white or maybe even Tyler Perry films... lol seriously people.  Are you all really that blind?ï»¿
"@Jason R lmao but Peter is here and your still complaining. Also a characters quality shouldn't be judged based off the color of the skin they have but their actually story and background. Needless to say miles is very well done intereation of spider man. Also he was created in 2011 way before pandering towards sjw groups really started to take hold. I'm not saying that diverserity for the sake of diversity is good, but miles is definitely a worth while character is pretty deserving of having his own movie.ï»¿"
"Lordgir25 1 I never said miles was never deserving of anything...  I can give you one reason why this is a cartoon.  If it flops they only cancel artists and voices with no concern of character contracts.  I will say this again my view is this story is stupid spiderman has been what he is for 56 years... you can like it, you can even love it. Most people appreciate original some like new school but everyone can dislike something that gets butchered... so much so the names are different the story is different... why even call him spider man??? If you don't understand that's fine just don't be surprised when someone makes a comment about this trash.ï»¿"
@Jason R whatever man that's  your hang up all ik is the movie looks dope.ï»¿

hoo boi im so excited ajsjkwkakï»¿
I like the musicï»¿
Is that a loli spidergirl?! MMMMMMM MUST LEWD HERï»¿
This movie is gonna be really bad. I had high hopes for this and I really thought it was gonna be good until this trailer. You can't have all these Spider-People be such an integral part of this story. They should stay as small references. Trying to get each Spider-Person back to their respective universe is a really lame plot. It should be about Miles Morales and maybe a little guidance from Peter Parker. Come on Sony don't screw everything up. Hopefully Venom will still be good...ï»¿

HOW MUCH WORSE ARE U GUYZ GONNA MAKE FUN OF SPIDER MAN?ï»¿
If we were at a time when superheroes werent all about bad comedy...i would have given this movie a chance. But lately (especially with Spider-Man) its all been terrible comedy. I want a serious story. Not something extremely dark. Just a well written story that doesnt have a joke every 5 minutes. The new Spider-Man game for PS4 managed to deliver a good balance. A shame that the same cannot be done in a cartoon version. Plus...the animation here looks bad and really doesnt impress me.ï»¿
You do realise that Spiderman has always been a jokester and making a dark situation into a joke. Thats literally always been Peter Parker's spiderman. Majority of the Spidermen have been jokesters say for a select few who were always serious.ï»¿

Agent 2514 if that's the case then why is Spider-man wearing the mask when in Spidey 2 Spider-man's mask is off. Its just a reference to the Raimi trilogy just like Spider-man PS4 referenced all three movie reboots and even other games.ï»¿

"Well this trailer lost me. Did we really need to make it a multidimensional end of the world story, built to set up multiple spin offs? It wouldâ€™ve been fine if it was just a simple story in one dimension about an older Peter Parker passing the torch to a young Miles Morales. Now with seven other main characters, thereâ€™s no room for a character arc on Milesâ€™ part, and the movie as a whole exists to set up ANOTHER cinematic universe. But I shouldâ€™ve guessed. Itâ€™s Sony, masters of screwing up Spider-Man and screwing up cinematic universes.ï»¿"
Miles is still the main character so he'll have his arcï»¿
Mike Morro But why do we need to throw in all these other Spider-Man characters? What do they add to the story? It should be just about Peter teaching Miles and keeping it at that. All these other characters literally exist to advertise spin offs.ï»¿

"Remember guys, what makes you different is what makes YOU Spidermanï»¿"
"But I thought the whole point of Spider-Man was itâ€™s still your every day guy with problems like you and me, who happens to be a super-hero so anyone can be Spider-Man. Or something like that.ï»¿"
Monika that means a lot. Lets all be spiderman!ï»¿
@LukaCola It is but let's forget that for the sake of watching this movie in a better light.ï»¿
"LukaCola A relatable Peter Parker went out the window as soon as he switched bodies with Doc Ock for two years. Then he had his own successful tech company, which isnâ€™t exactly relatable for most people. Letâ€™s face it. Itâ€™s all about â€œthe eventâ€ù or â€œthe messageâ€ù in comics now instead of â€œthe charactersâ€ù. Heck, they even did a Civil War II just to have a Civil War II.ï»¿"

"This is the second time Peter Parkerâ€™s Spider-man started breaking the 4th wall since Disneyâ€™s Ultimate Spider-man tv show, because he already acknowledges being in comics, cereal boxes and... Christmas albums? I know the Ninja Turtles had a Christmas Album called we wish you a Turtle Christmas, but I donâ€™t recall spidey having a Christmas album except some Christmas specials in Spider-man comics and TV cartoons, so why does Peter Parker the Original Spider-man like breaking the 4th wall like Deadpool these days? Awesome new trailer by the way.ï»¿"

1:44 - On the right - Tom Holland's Spider-man: Far from home costume?ï»¿
Brick FORCE Studios no thatâ€™s Spider-Man noir from the comics in a different universeï»¿
Brick FORCE Studios itâ€™s the Spider-Man: noir suit. NOT the suit from far from home. If anything the far from home suit pays homage to the noir suit.ï»¿
Thats noir ._.ï»¿
That's noir. the leaked footage might be a homeage to it or the stealth suitï»¿
Looks more like the Secret Wars Suitï»¿

"okay okay this looks UNBELEIVABLE. AMAZING. (see what I did there.)but if your gonna give spider-gwen pointe shoes at least do the research to make it correct technique. when she lands in the tree she WOULD NOT be on her shoes the way she is. her feet would be fully pointed, ankles fully extended, and she would be resting on the front of shoes. the way she is sitting, (@ 1:25) there is NO support for her body. and she would be in immense pain if she sat like that for more than 2 milliseconds. you CAN NOT be on pointe and have your ankles bent. it's poor technique, it's dangerous, and you will not be allowed to do pointe without strong ankles (its literally like requirement number 1).PLS HALPplease fix this. please.ï»¿"

Why does every new main character have to be black? Itâ€™s really annoying. Why not Mexican or Native American? The people who actually own this land and should be use to promote Native culture and people but no just black People.ï»¿
I mean miles isn't just black  tho he's also been portayed as Latin and sometimes half and half. The only really reason they go with black miles is because it's his most common depiction over the years that he has been spiderman.ï»¿

"In the MCU, they basically took Ganke (Milesâ€™ Asian best friend and roommate) and renamed him Ned Leeds (a Caucasian reporter Pete met as an adult who eventually married Betty Brant). The confusionâ€™s understandable. I wonder who came up with this idea for Homecoming. Tbh, itâ€™d probably be better if MCUâ€™s Ned was a character made specifically for the MCU, just like Coulson.ï»¿"
"In the comics, Ganke Lee adopted the name Ned to hide his true identity from Danika Hart. Both Ganke Lee and Ned Leeds share similarities, they both like superheroes and LEGO and their physical appearanceï»¿"

"oooo okay so that is why its so laggy. Coraline looked a bit more fluid tho, i hope they add a bit more framerate smoothness cause it was hard to look at in the fast pace scenes.ï»¿"
"It's not stop motion. It's purposefully animated ""on-twos,"" meaning the picture only changes every two frames. It's a style derived from traditional hand-drawn animation, and it's used here to fit the comic book style they're going for.ï»¿"
I think Sony is gonna overdo spider man [out of greed for money] and make him exhausted.ï»¿

So did Peter die in miles universe or did he never exist because if that's the case then that's stupid as hell. I know in the comics he died but I hope they do that in this movie to. I also think if they were gonna do an older Peter then they  should go with him having kids with mj because that could easily lead to a cool spin off.ï»¿

"Wait, no joke, its really nicholas cage voicing him?? :/ï»¿"
@Joshua De Joya yeahï»¿
Imagine if they had got Tobey as the voice actor for Peter in thisï»¿
Wider Spider he's not as witty or funny as this actor.ï»¿
"Starcrap 64 You realize the actors are reading from a script, right?ï»¿"
I like Yuri Lowenthal moreï»¿
"Thrawn Mon and you realize actors also have to, you know, ACT?ï»¿"
Wider Spider Last time I checked whenever he did a voice over role it wasnâ€™t that goodï»¿
"_Ÿ”´ Already watched ""SPIDER MAN: INTO THE SPIDER VERSE"" Movie t.co/3Hodi5yZnU Unglaublicher film! Sehr zu empfehlen, es auszuprobieren!ï»¿"
@Thrawn Mon I think he means more that he lacks charisma and gives a boring performance as the character that people only cherish out of pure nostalgia or the fact that they may not be big fans of the character so they don't really know any other Spider Man all that well and default to the Maguire Spider Man even though the Maguire Spider Man really isn't all that greatï»¿
"Dan the Magic Man and Tobey is a good actor, so I fail to see your pointï»¿"
In Brazil Peter is being voiced by the same voice actor that did the voice of Toby's spider-manï»¿

TheCanineLady actually thatâ€™s false. Ned was inspired by Milesâ€™ friend Danke. Ned was based off miles morales.ï»¿

Hopefully heâ€™ll make at least a cameo. I will be very disappointed if he doesnâ€™t show up at all. Same goes for black suit ultimate Spidermanï»¿

What if in order to save everyone and get them back home peter sacrifices himself and the scene with miles at the Tombstone is the endï»¿
"Loving the style so much. 3D CG space/models, 2D Comic Book texture/linework and Stop-Motion movement, flawless combination. And that bi-colour, 3D silhouette thing is giving me flashbacks to when that was what 3D looked like, when you wore paper glasses with a red and blue lens instead of plastic sunglasses, neat!Also pretty neat to finally have a Spidey film where Peter Parker's not the main character (Not counting Venom, since there's hardly any mention of Spider-man in it).I also like how this film takes ""Cinematic Universe"" literally, and brings all the movie-goers up to speed with some pretty signifcant bits of lore from the comics.Even if it never gets released or the film doesn't meet the hype of these awesome trailers; You've redeemed yourself from the Emoji Movie, Sony. You've actually expressed Passion, Innovation and Ambition in these trailers; and that's what the film industry needs way more of.ï»¿"

When is it going to be out?ï»¿
AAAWESOMEEEE!!!!ï»¿
loved that the Spider-Man (Peter Parker) is Tobey Maguire.ï»¿
that isn't Tobey's version. That train shot was just a referenceï»¿
He's not...ï»¿
It's Jake Johnsonï»¿
"The voice actor is Toby Macguire? I didn't recognize his voice, it's been some time so I hear him differentlyï»¿"

@Francisco Serrano -_-ï»¿
Why you spreading fake newsï»¿
Is it really?ï»¿
"Francisco Serrano itâ€™s not him, theyâ€™re just referencesï»¿"
@Starcrap 64 Read nigga.... READ!!!ï»¿
"He really isn't though, it's just more of a really direct and on the nose reference to the movies.ï»¿"
its just a reference idiotï»¿
"Obviously it's not Tobey's voice, but I was talking about the scenes shown are from trilogy starring Tobey Maguire.ï»¿"
I feel like it's definitely Sam Raimi Spidey and Jake Johnson is doing a Tobey Maguire impressionï»¿
I was wondering if the peter parker in this movie was the one from the movies based on those scenes with tobey maguire but that would be a pretty confusing thing to doï»¿
"It never says it's Tobey's version, but they DEFINITELY want the audience to asume that (it has the train part, the kiss upside down, the clasic suit, the car almost hitting MJ while having a date) all of this scenes are shown on the Sam Raimi's trilogy.ï»¿"
No it's meï»¿
@x destor also 2:01 looks like Kristen Dunst MJ for meï»¿
@rockzs74r yesï»¿
"0:14 Not him, Tobeyâ€™s version doesnâ€™t use web shooters.ï»¿"

@Aram R/A agreed.ï»¿
"It has a purpose. I believe this technique is ""animating on twos"". It's used here to create the illusion of a moving comic book, with the choppy animation sort of mimicking how you would switch between comic panels. The comic effect is even more apparent when you notice the halftone filters in most of the shots.ï»¿"

Its supposed to take the effect of a comic book.ï»¿

This trailer is good and all but.....where is my boy Miguel?ï»¿
I love this soo much!ï»¿
"I love how all of the situations Peter is shown in is a reference to the Tobey Maguire/Sam Raimi Spider-Man. He did the stopping the train, upside down kiss with MJ, and having a date with MJ and a car being tossed to his back. Only in this version he turns around and punches the car.ï»¿"
Yep definitely Toby's SpiderManï»¿
Love that Sami Raimi Spiderman reference at 0.12ï»¿

Black spiderman? thats weirdï»¿
Is this movie an adaptation from that Spider-Verse episode from the Ultimate Spider-Man series?ï»¿
ye to dhamaka hai spiderman kaï»¿
What's sad is that more effort was put into this than the Venom movie. And I'm okay with that.ï»¿
loliï»¿
"Okay, now this is E_Ÿ…±ï¸èicï»¿"
"The fact that this is made by Sony Animation makes me lose my hope. But let's see if it's good. Homecoming was painfully average,so I guess I'm hoping for this to fix that.ï»¿"
Guess this Peter Parker didn't have a Gwen Stacy in his universe to die on him.ï»¿
This..does put smile on my face..._Ÿ˜ç_Ÿ‘Œ_Ÿè_ï»¿

"Seeing Raimi references""Sony was a hero...I just couldn't see it.""ï»¿"
"I hope they do what they did in the Spiderverse comic, make a reference to seeing Spider-Men that look like the guy from Seabiscuit and The Social Network.ï»¿"
"Oh sh*t, this one is super cool, but this trailer revealed too much of the STORY. It would have been great if some things remained hidden.ï»¿"
With great thoterry comes a greater peace.ï»¿
Pete sounds like Fe4RLessï»¿
i dont feel so goodï»¿
I like the throwback references but you should have used Tobey as the voice actor instead of some guy that sounds like a pothead. Doesnâ€™t fit the character at all.ï»¿
Super heroï»¿
Like the sam raimi refferences.ï»¿
"YEAR OF MARVEL. Better, YEAR OF SPIDERMAN. ( Tom Holland in infinity war, hardy in venom, then these guys...... TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. SPIDERFANS , brace urselves. _Ÿ˜_ï»¿"

Now Spidey has waifus on his movie. I'm interested in such a wrong way. It looks great af too. I hope our hero SUPAIDAMAN makes a cameo at least.ï»¿
"The inverted kissThe train stoppingThe car fly into dinerYup, I see you there Tobeyï»¿"
...Are you implying this is the  Spidey from the Sam Raimi films?ï»¿
Manuel Alberto Romero no itâ€™s just references to those moviesï»¿
Oh Boy Yeahï»¿
"The train is as canon as it gets, where ever peter is there.ï»¿"
@Manuel Alberto Romero I mean he even do the naration from Sam Raimi Spidermanï»¿
Well... this movie bascily says that there are many universes with different people. This means that all spider-man movies are in a away Canon. Well all of them atleast in different universes.ï»¿
I think it's not meant to be him but still a Peter with a very similar trajectory to the Sam Raimi films.ï»¿
Funny you say that. The brazillan voice actor for Peter its the same for Tobey.ï»¿
"I think it is the same but also not the same as he has the mask on during the train scene and the entire suit during the dinner scene. So a different timeline where similar stuff happens, but not exactly the same universe as those movies.ï»¿"
"Every Spider-Man is canon. They all exist in different universes. Raimi Spider-Man, 60s cartoon Spider-Man (he even cameos in a Spider-Verse comic), MCU Spider-Man, Insomniac's PS4 Spider-Man, all canon.ï»¿"
Best spidey is tobeyï»¿

"This film is going to do to Sony Pictures Animation what Kung Fu Panda did to DreamWorks Animation.(EXPLAINATION: Kung Fu Panda helped redeem DreamWorks after films from 2004-2007 such as Shark Tale and Shrek the Third did poorly with critics despite box office success, and Into the Spider-Verse is looking to do the same thing to Sony Animation following last year's turkey that was the Emoji Movie. And yes, I'm aware that they were trying to compete with Disney & Pixar from the beginning and that they already had Shrek 1 to their name.)ï»¿"
what do you mean?ï»¿
I...I genuinely can't tell if this is supposed to be a compliment or insult.ï»¿
@Brian Fitzsimmons Kung Fu Panda is fantastic so... A complement?ï»¿

Brian Fitzsimmons It's a compliment alright.ï»¿
Parker is the inly spiderman. This movies and the spiderverse are kek. Pure kek.ï»¿

Here we go to the spider verseï»¿

@Madalin way to ruin the fun lol.ï»¿
@Madalin I see a button _Ÿ_”ï»¿
"That will be be super dope if it was Spider-Man 4, Sam Raimi trilogy are live action and this one is animatedï»¿"
"It is similar but not the same as he has the mask on during the train scene, and during the dinner with MJ he has the entire suit on. And as others have stated, he does not shoot webs out of his body. So a universe where a lot of the same stuff happened but still not exactly like it. Probably just added as sort of an homage to the Reimi trilogy.ï»¿"
ThePumaoX You can see the Insomniacâ€™s Spidey PS4 suit in this trailer. Itâ€™s at 1:39-1:40.ï»¿
"@inusha De Silva , yeah, that button is for the web shooters at his wrist, and the wrist is not drawn in that photo so its probably to save time on animating.ï»¿"

I bet it can't beat Last Reign Spider-Man. Radioactive Sperm.ï»¿

Better than Tom Holland thoï»¿
Well they aren't gonna show everyone he is close to because its just gonna spoil it and of course he is lonely in miles universe in which he knows no one thereï»¿

Well this actully looks good . And yes you can take in association with Marvel very serious . Originaly Sony did have not the rights to use Miles Morales or spider-Gwen . But thanks to their sharing deal with Marvel . That allows spider-man to appear in Mcu . And sonyâ€™s spider-man movies with Tom Holland to be set in the mcu (I loved spider-man homecoming and I am gonna love Spider-man far from home) This beautiful animated movie is here.. I am gonna see this ...ï»¿

Jason Hannigan your mother is mediocreï»¿
F30 Rocity it's a straight rip off of Batman just with clunky fighting mechanics and boring missions and side missions. Story is cool and web swinging is cool. They are the only things that keep it worth playing. (I have 30 hours in it that's why I'm critizcing it)ï»¿

Prakhar Mishra and Venom is coming outï»¿
"@Jewish Jesus no, people think it's Arkham rip off because they're not doing it right. Mashing square with circle occasionally is not the way to play. The combat is designed so that you improvise, mix and match different gadgets. Plus, it has a LOT more similarities with Spider-Man 2. If you have the game, try using your web shooters more often. Uppercut, web shoot 4 times then hold triangle. Web enemies on ground, near walls. Use impact webbing wisely. Use suspension matrix to get out of tough spots. It's a fantastic combat system, and even more amazing is the fact that Insomniac nailed it so well, this being their first time doing melee combat in one of their games.ï»¿"

It wasnâ€™t really used in comics cause people want traditional Spider-Man 3. The outfit is retarded. A giant white spider?

"And this is how you make an animated movie in 2018, DC.ï»¿"
ì¯”ìœ„-ah chill mate this is like marvel first good animated movie. DC have had plenty of great animated movies.ï»¿
I am imagining Marco Diaz taking coffee like in your profile pic and saying that lolï»¿
Its Sony's movie who have purchased rights from Marvel!ï»¿
- and how about you just stop comparing DC with marvel.ï»¿
DC made far better animated movies than Marvel in last 10 yearsï»¿
"Only thing that sucks in DC is DC live action movies. The comics, the games and cartoons are far superioir that that of marvel's.ï»¿"
Lol thatâ€™s a is literally the first good marvel animated movie ever. Dc has more than enough.ï»¿
"1, how do u know its good?2. what animated movie did dc make in 2018 that was bad?ï»¿"
Batman under the red hood anyone...Justice League Dark...Batman mask of the phantasmï»¿
ì¯”ìœ„-ah DC has TONS of amazing animated movies. Where have you been? This might actually be Marvelâ€™s best animated movie. The only other animation theyâ€™ve had is The Spectacular Spider-Man and that was great. Donâ€™t try to start to flame war when you donâ€™t understand another companyâ€™s success.ï»¿
Dc has alot of good animated movies and it's better than marvel's. This is maybe the first good marvel animated film. So stop trashing dc cuz mcu movies are better. You can't just judge dc cuz u watched justuce league lmaoï»¿
"i cant believe someone can be this ignorant lmfaocomparing Marvel to DC out of nowhere not even realising that they're WAY better than Marvel at animated movies and showsï»¿"
@dylan jackson also we dont know if it is gonna be good at firstï»¿
Yeah only from Sony and not really marvel themselves who constantly fucked up their animation. Also Sony animation is that done the emojis movieï»¿
Marvel is just catching up hereï»¿
You sir are a complete idiot. Probably never even seen a DC animated movie.ï»¿
Try beat Batman Ninja then we talk!ï»¿
"What are you talking about, DC is awesome at making animated movies and thats a factï»¿"
"DC be coming out with good stuff,like teen titans the judas contractï»¿"
The new 52 movies have been lacking. But everything before was miles ahead of Marvelâ€™s animation.ï»¿
I think he means Washington DCï»¿
Blind hate for DC gets upvotes. This dude probably never watched a DC animation in his life.ï»¿
"Nah DC's good at the animated ones, they're cancer with the live action onesï»¿"
"Polis Angkasa Gaban Batman Ninja was stupid. Lmao. It was super fun, but it was one of the dumbest animated movies Iâ€™ve ever seen.ï»¿"
DC cartoons are far more superior than Marvel cartoons lolï»¿
"This look really bad comare to dc movies like assult on harkam, tdkr, the lego batman movie,flashpoint and moreï»¿"
"Relax bro, this isn't even a Marvel animated movie. It's made by Sony. Marvel will never be able to match DC in animated movies.ï»¿"
"Teen Titans Go! To The Movies still got a 100% Rotten Tomatoes rating, that's pretty impressiveï»¿"
DC made a lot of good animated moviesï»¿
dc knows how to make animated movies lmaoï»¿
Making that big of a judgment even before seeing the movie? Niceï»¿
Naw mate.. DC rules animated movies! Especially with the Batman ones _Ÿ‘€ Teen Titans vs. Justice League is also fire. So many good onesï»¿
Shut the hell up puppetï»¿

"You know the Teen Titans Go movie has a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes, right?ï»¿"
Iâ€™m pretty sure Big Hero 6 was based on a Marvel property.ï»¿
"Hahaha what a stupid kid. In live action movies Marvel is better, but in animated movies DC is completely on a different level.ï»¿"
"As far as I know, this year DC made Batman Ninja, which was pretty crazy and rad, and Teen Titans Go, which was hilarious and is an example of how to make a Deadpool-style movie for kids.ï»¿"
dc has done a better job with animated movies for years unlike with marvelï»¿
MCFLY bh6 wasnâ€™t even that goodï»¿
DC and Marvel are really good but Marvel's live action movies are better than DC's in my opinionï»¿
Idk Spider-Man PS4 is pre good.ï»¿
"DCâ€™s best movies are arguably itâ€™s animated ones. With the exception of say, Wonder Woman, many of their recent films have been disasters. Almost all of their animated ones are actually pretty enjoyable.ï»¿"

"So is the this the ""Tobey Maguire,Sam Raimi"" Peter Parker? Saw at least two Raimi Spiderman 2 references.ï»¿"
Forgot to mention the SpiderMan 1 reference. The MJ upsidedown kiss.ï»¿

"3 actually, the car throw in the diner from spiderman 2, stoping the train from 2 and inverted kissing from 1ï»¿"
The one in the new ps4 game makes a spiderman 2 referenceï»¿
I believe so.ï»¿
Iâ€™d guess itâ€™ll be like LEGO Batman where it references multiple past versionsï»¿
Plus was that spider-pig from the Simpsons?ï»¿
"Glad to see Spider-Ham finally getting some love on the big screen. In case people don't know, he was a popular comic book series back in the 80's.ï»¿"
Those were even in the game its like a staple at this pointï»¿
I counted 3.ï»¿
"NinjasCreedZA imo theyâ€™re just funny nods. Like â€œI saved the city, got the girlâ€ù etc and for examples they just show those as references. But hey, could be wrong. If it was they shouldâ€™ve got Toby to voice him.ï»¿"
@Nik Turk That's Spider-Ham. He's been around since the 80'sï»¿
The idea of a seasoned Spiderman is awesome.ï»¿
"@Nik Turk no, that's peter porker the spectacular Spider-hamï»¿"
Nik Turk No its spiderham. Spiderham came out decades before spiderpig from the Simpson's. Spider pig was actually not very original at all.ï»¿
"@Nik Turk no, spider-ham is an actual alternate reality Spidey where everyone is an anthropomorphic animal. His name is Peter Porker. No joke.ï»¿"
Yeah they are coz my be its continuity of sony spider universeï»¿
@munkeemojo ok thanksï»¿
This IS TOBEY MAQUIREï»¿
"That isn't Tobey's Spiderman. Tobey's Spiderman has organic webs, this Spiderman has webshooters. Also ps4 Spiderman references some of those scenes as well. This is probably from the comics where Peter is 30 years old, and has a company called Parker Industries. He also has a secret base where he keeps his suits on display like Iron Man as you can see in the trailer.ï»¿"
Xï»¿
@Nik Turk Actually Spider-Ham is from another universe an was introduced in the comics before he was featured in the Simpson'sï»¿

"Just pasue at 1:45 when they all look at the camera. Two things:1) Badass new wallpaper2) The blendind of art syles is GORGEOUS! Peter and Miles look more 2D classic comic book drawings, Gwen looks more 3D modern neon, Spider-ham has that child friendly animation, Peni looks like a 3D rendered anime character, and Noir (my favorite) looks like the art cover to classic mystery novels.

"@qwerttzizzi no, spider-ham is from 83 and spider-pig is from 2007ï»¿"
I meant DC should theatrically release their animated movies.ï»¿
"@ziljin oh, that makes more sense. Yeah I agree, if they got a bigger budget and a bit longer to make the films, i think they could be better then any of the live action movies, i fact i already prefer them, if they just had confidence in their animasion.ï»¿"

"Im so glad people are appreciating this movie, the second I saw the trailer I expected Non fans to go crazy about both the plot and art style, but true fans know about the hundreds of different spider variations , and honestly, Im a bit more hyped for this, than Venom!ï»¿"
Lukas Eriksson donâ€™t gatekeep with that true fan bullshit. You probably never even read a spider-man comicï»¿
ohhh rekt mateï»¿
Venom is gonna suck and this looks graphically discomforting. The FPS is AWFULï»¿
"@sanderflop lmao I was the nerdiest kid growing up, especially for spider man, I was so obsessed with him I wore a spider man costume everyday for like a month at ten years old until my mam forced me to take the costume off, to wash it obviously, I even wore it to a tenth birthday party where I refused to eat because that meant taking the mask off! _Ÿ˜‚ I still have some of the older, rarer comics to this date in the attic. Trust man, people only think of the Sam Raimi films when they think spiderman, and the universe is so much larger than those movies! Seeing other people be excited for this is a great thing to seeï»¿"
Lukas Eriksson Why do you have to distinguish â€œnon-fansâ€ù and â€œtrue fansâ€ù. You donâ€™t have to know all the trivia and variants to be a fan. Non-fans are just people who donâ€™t like Spider-Man.ï»¿
"Because ""non fans"" is the correct terminology for people who aren't a fan of spiderman, and I expected those people to get angry that it's not like the original trilogy, obviously fans are going to know about the other variations of spider man. But people think spider man and always think of Peter Parker, not the countless other versions. If you're not a fan that's fine, but it's always the none fans that complain about stuff like this, stuff they don't understandï»¿"
YES! AND THEY LOOK SO DISTINCTLY DESIGNED!!!ï»¿
WHOOOOOO!!ï»¿

Don't take me a hundred percent accurate but I think they said they not going to do 2099 because he's been in every spider verse and then went to do their own thingï»¿

The scanner darkly type animation for this film is perfect. The water color style painting aspect is incredible mixes with the stop motion animation sequence. Peter Parker is a fun version of Tony Stark.ï»¿

I should add that Peter is also waay better in terms of personalityï»¿

Itâ€™s nothing like its animation considering they used real people and added effects. This is all drawn out in a computer like what Pixar does. I think you need to learn filming lmfaoï»¿
"Scanner Darkly type animation??? Stop motion????? dude, what the hell are you talking about. You and the hundreds of people who thumbs you up don't know anything about animation. it's kinda embarrassing, but I get it, when you don't know how to describe it, you just use the closest things that come to mind as examples, even tho they are wayyyy off.ï»¿"

The only other fully negative comment I can find at the moment is calling it a turd in the wind but yet again others love it.... I feel it'll be fun but not greatï»¿"
I donâ€™t know why Sony even bothers. They shouldâ€™ve given venom to Marvelï»¿
never believe critics. they're all idiotsï»¿
"@jack lajoie if a vast majority of people are saying venom is bad, even people who wanted to like it I'd believe it over blindly paying to see something thats complete garbage. Venom looks like it has bits in it but making a venom movie detached from his original origins destroys the entire purpose of their even being a venom.ï»¿"
"If Tom Hardy's that good as Eddie Brock/Venom, then if the movie bombs and the SUMC universe is dead, they can just shoehorn Eddie into the MCU by having him go through a multi-verse portal Doctor Strange accidentally creates.ï»¿"

"@TheCreed1217 Tell that to marvel. that's not stopping them with the whole ""god of the symbiotes"" BS.ï»¿"
"@StardustCrusade No they weren't. They're all by official blue-tick accounts that work for major publications. Some Gaga fans are posting fake reactions but that happens whenever a Marvel/DC movie is released by the fans of the opposite camp anyway, and it doesn't change the fact that all of the OFFICIAL reviews are negative.ï»¿"

@Temple King well they have to cut corners to put SP//dr in the movie.ï»¿
"Sheâ€™s freakin adorable, they should make a spin off animated miniseries based on herï»¿"

@The Real Michael Garcia im talking about the movies not thisï»¿
They released this to distract you from the VENOM reviews.ï»¿
Captain Zeal are the reviews bad?ï»¿
"The reviews arenâ€™t out yet. Unfortunately, they probably wonâ€™t be great, which is a shame.ï»¿"
@Ham Burglar they are outï»¿
Yupï»¿
@Ham Burglar Some are and they're obviously negativeï»¿
Captain Zeal â€œearly â€œ reviewsï»¿
Social reviews are out. Not looking good so far.ï»¿
"@Nathan Lemuel the reviews are mixed, you guys are acting as if it's straight up negativeï»¿"
Ham Burglar they're out and they're so badï»¿
Flik Rancherson it's at least 70% negativeï»¿
Idc about the reviews i going to check it out for my selfï»¿
@ElijahDawgOne most reviews on twitter are bots all saying the same stuff about the movie being badï»¿
Flik Rancherson Iâ€™m not.  Iâ€™m being realistic. They are mixed to negative. The only good thing that is being said is Tom Hardyâ€™s performance. And even that is a mixed bag. People are just confused by the movie.ï»¿
And what a good distraction!ï»¿
"The reviews are no true out, just the social media reactions.ï»¿"
"@Nathan Lemuel I've literally reread all the articles just now, the positives have said that the movie has charm as well as great main character dynamic, there's a lot more to it than just mixed to negative, I'll hold my opinion for when the critics get a hold of it.ï»¿"
@Nathan Lemuel I feel bad for Tom Hardy. He went from Dunkirk to this.ï»¿
This first reviews fells like the first one's from Deadpool 2 that said was a boring movie with nothing to offer.ï»¿
Flik Rancherson And all of that positive buzz has to do with Tom Hardy.ï»¿
Flik Rancherson Critics did get a hold of it. Some of them. At the Hollywood premiere.ï»¿
Captain Zeal He went from Inception to this.ï»¿
@Nathan Lemuel He's already started distancing himself from the movie saying 40 minutes of it were cut.ï»¿
Captain Zeal Pulling a Jared Leto I see.ï»¿
"And by reviews he means 1000s of bots plugging Lady Gaga's new film and a couple of ""reviews"" from some Twitter randos.ï»¿"
"@A Skeleton You're right about the  lady gaga bots, just read about it now. But there are mixed to negative reviews by genuine sources.ï»¿"
@Nathan Lemuel Lmao yeah. Venom got zacksnydered.ï»¿
https://twitter.com/_brooklynbatman/status/1047082514488201216?s=21ï»¿
"@Nathan Lemuel Even though the lady gaga film is getting positive reviews, it will be tough for it to beat Venom. First, venom is one of the most popular marvel characters, second it's a superhero genre film. Unless in the coming days it gets completely panned like Fantastic 4, i think it will do okay at the box office.ï»¿"
Captain Zeal Iâ€™m pretty sure it will be number one at the box office on opening weekend. Maybe its second week too. Depends on general word of mouth.ï»¿

Beningame dude he was introduced in the ultimate comics. Im not a big fan of him either but hes been a staple for a lotta years my dude. This is just focusing on the ultimate universe colliding with the other universes. Also miles is black and Hispanic mix.ï»¿

"@Luis Manuel Deras He's not gonna be in Venom though, maybe at most a surprise cameo but I doubt so at the moment. They should really make the first Venom film solely based on Venom vs Riot and not foreshadow others like Spider-Man or Carnage.
